this first book proposes first in brief the whole subject mans disobedience and the loss thereupon of paradise wherein he was plac t then touches the prime cause of his fall the serpent or rather satan in the serpent who revolting from god and drawing to his side many legions of angels was by the command of god driven out of heaven with all his crew into the great deep which action past over the poem hasts into the midst of things presenting satan with his angels now fallen into hell describ d here not in the center for heaven and earth may be suppos d as yet not made certainly not yet accurst but in a place of utter darkness fitliest call d chaos here satan with his angels lying on the burning lake thunder struck and astonisht after a certain space recovers as from confusion calls up him who next in order and dignity lay by him they confer of thir miserable fall satan awakens all his legions who lay till then in the same manner confounded they rise thir numbers array of battel thir chief leaders nam d according to the idols known afterwards in canaan and the countries adjoyning to these satan directs his speech comforts them with hope yet of regaining heaven but tells them lastly of a new world and new kind of creature to be created according to an ancient prophesie or report in heaven for that angels were long before this visible creation was the opinion of many ancient fathers to find out the truth of this prophesie and what to determin thereon he refers to a full councel what his associates thence attempt pandemonium the palace of satan rises suddenly built out of the deep the infernal peers there sit in councel of man s first disobedience and the fruit of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste brought death into the world and all our woe with loss of eden till one greater man restore us and regain the blissful seat sing heavenly muse that on the secret top of oreb or of sinai didst inspire that shepherd who first taught the chosen seed in the beginning how the heavens and earth rose out of chaos or if sion hill delight thee more and siloa s brook that flowed fast by the oracle of god i thence invoke thy aid to my adventurous song that with no middle flight intends to soar above th aonian mount while it pursues things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme and chiefly thou o spirit that dost prefer before all temples th upright heart and pure

hell say first what cause mov d our grand parents in that happy state favour d of heav n so highly to fall off from their creator and transgress his will for one restraint lords of the world besides who first seduc d them to that foul revolt th infernal serpent he it was whose guile stirred up with envy and revenge deceived the mother of mankind what time his pride had cast him out from heav n with all his host of rebel angels by whose aid aspiring to set himself in glory above his peers he trusted to have equal d the most high if he oppos d and with ambitious aim against the throne and monarchy of god rais d impious war in heav n and battle proud with vain attempt him the almighty power hurled headlong flaming from th ethereal sky with hideous ruin and combustion down to bottomless perdition there to dwell in adamantine chains and penal fire who durst defy th omnipotent to arms nine times the space that measures day and night to mortal men he with his horrid crew lay vanquished rolling in the fiery gulf confounded though immortal but his doom reserv d him to more wrath for now the thought both of lost happiness and lasting pain torments him round he throws his baleful eyes that witness d huge affliction and dismay mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate at once as far as angels kenn he views the dismal situation waste and wilde a dungeon horrible on all sides round as one great furnace flam d yet from those flames no light but rather darkness visible serv d only to discover sights of woe regions of sorrow doleful shades where peace and rest can never dwell hope never comes that comes to all but torture without end still urges and a fiery deluge fed with ever burning sulphur unconsume d such place eternal justice had prepar d for those rebellious here their prison ordain d in utter darkness and their portion set as far remov d from god and light of heav n as from the centre thrice to th utmost pole oh how unlike the place from whence they fell there the companions of his fall o erwhelm d with floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire he soon discerns and weltering by his side one next himself in power and next in crime long after known in palestine

happy realms of light cloth d with transcendent brightness didst outshine myriads though bright if he whom mutual league united thoughts and counsels equal hope and hazard in the glorious enterprise joynd with me once now misery hath joined in equal ruin into what pit thou seest from what height fall n so much the stronger provd he with his thunder and till then who knew the force of those dire arms yet not for those nor what the potent victor in his rage can else inflict do i repent or change though chang d in outward lustre that fixt mind and high disdain from sense of injur d merit that with the mightiest rais d me to contend and to the fierce contentions brought along innumerable force of spirits arm d that durst dislike his reign and me preferring his utmost power with adverse

to submit or yield and what is else not to be overcome that glory never shall his wrath or might extort from me to bow and sue for grace with suppliant knee and deify his power who from the terror of this arm so late doubted his empire that were low indeed that were an ignominy and shame beneath this downfall since by fate the strength of gods and this empyreal sybstance cannot fail since through experience of this great event in arms not worse in foresight much advanc t we may with more successful hope resolve to wage by force or guile eternal war irreconcilable to our grand foe who now triumphs and in th excess of joy sole reigning holds the tyranny of heav n so spake th apostate angel though in pain vaunting aloud but racked with deep despair and him thus answer d soon his bold compeer o prince o chief of many throned powers that led th imbattled seraphim to war under thy conduct and in dreadful deeds fearless endanger d heav ns perpetual king and put to proof his high supremacy whether upheld by strength or chance or fate too well i see and rue the dire event that with sad overthrow and foul defeat hath lost us heav n and all this mighty host in horrible destruction laid thus low as far as gods and heav nly essences can perish for the mind and spirit remains invincible and vigour soon returns though all our glory extinct and happy state here swallow d up in endless misery but what if he our conquerour whom i now of force believe almighty since no less then such could have orepow rd such force as ours have left us this our spirit and strength entire strongly to suffer and support our pains that we may so suffice his vengeful ire or do him mightier service as his thralls by right of war what e re his business be here in the heart of hell to work in fire or do his errands in the gloomy deep what can it the avail though yet we feel strength undiminished or eternal being to undergo eternal punishment whereto with speedy words th arch fiend reply d fall n cherube to be weak is miserable doing or suffering but of this be sure to do ought good never will be our task but ever to do ill our sole delight as being the contrary to his high will whom we resist if then his providence out of our evil seek to bring forth good our labour must be to pervert that end and out of good still to find means of evil which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps shall grieve him if i fail not and disturb his inmost counsels from their destined aim but see the angry victor hath recall d his ministers of vengeance and pursuit back to the gates of heav n the sulphurous hail shot after us in storm oreblown hath laid the fiery surge that from the precipice of heav n receiv d us falling and the thunder wing d with red lightning and impetuous rage perhaps hath spent his shafts and ceases now to bellow through the vast and boundless deep let us not slip th occasion whether scorn or satiate fury yield it from our foe seest thou yon dreary plain forlorn and wilde the seat of desolation voyd of light save what the glimmering of these livid flames casts pale and dreadful thither let us tend from off the tossing of these fiery waves there rest if any rest can harbour there and reassembling our afflicted powers consult how we may henceforth most offend our enemy our own loss how repair how overcome this dire calamity what reinforcement we may gain from hope if not what resolution from despare thus satan talking to his nearest mate with head up lift above the wave and eyes that sparkling blaz d his other parts besides prone on the flood extended long and large lay floating many a rood in bulk as huge as whom the fables name of monstrous size titanian or earth born that warr d on jove briarios or typhon whom the den by ancient tarsus held or that sea beast leviathan which god of all his works created hugest that swim th ocean stream him haply slumbering on the norway foam the pilot of some small night founder d skiff deeming some island oft as sea men tell with fixed anchor in his scaly rind moors by his side under the lee while night invests the sea and wished morn delayes so stretched out huge in length the arch fiend lay chained on the burning lake nor ever thence had risen or heaved his head but that the will and high permission of all ruling heaven left him at large to his own dark designs that with reiterated crimes he might heap on himself damnation while he sought evil to others and enrag d might see how all his malice serv d but to bring forth infinite goodness grace and mercy shewn on man by him seduc t but on himself treble confusion wrath and vengeance pour d forthwith upright he rears from off the pool his mighty stature on each hand the flames drivn backward slope their pointing spires rowld in billows leave i th midst a horrid vale then with expanded wings he steers his flight aloft incumbent on the dusky air that felt unusual weight till on dry land he lights if it were land that ever burn d with

his next mate both glorying to have scap t the stygian flood as gods and by their own recover d strength not by the sufferance of supernal power is this the region this the soil the clime said then the lost archangel this the seat that we must change for heav n this mournful gloom for that celestial light be it so since hee who now is sovran can dispose and bid what shall be right farthest from him is best whom reason hath equald force hath made supreme above his equals farewell happy fields where joy for ever dwells hail horrours hail infernal world and thou profoundest hell receive thy new possessor one who brings a mind not to be chang d by place or time the mind is its own place and in itself can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven what matter where if i be still the same and what i should be all but less than hee whom thunder hath made greater here at least we shall be free th almighty hath not built here for his envy will not drive us hence here we may reign secure and in my choice to reign is worth ambition though in hell better to reign in hell than serve in heav n but wherefore let we then our faithful friends th associates and copartners of our loss lye thus astonished on th oblivious pool and call them not to share with us their part in this unhappy mansion or once more with rallied arms to try what may be yet regaind in heav n or what more lost in hell so satan spake and him beelzebub thus answer d leader of those armies bright which but th omnipotent none could have foyld if once they hear that voyce their liveliest pledge of hope in fears and dangers heard so oft in worst extreams and on the perilous edge of battel when it rag d in all assaults their surest signal they will soon resume new courage and revive though now they lye groveling

and wardrobe in the order wherein i should wish to leave them during a brief absence meantime i heard st john quit his room he stopped at my door i feared he would knock no but a slip of paper was passed under the door i took it up it bore these words you left me too suddenly last night had you stayed but a little longer you would have laid your hand on the christian s cross and the angel s crown i shall expect your clear decision when i return this day fortnight meantime watch and pray that you enter not into temptation the spirit i trust is willing but the flesh i see is weak i shall pray for you hourly yours st john my spirit i answered mentally is willing to do what is right and my flesh i hope is strong enough to accomplish the will of heaven when once that will is distinctly known to me at any rate it shall be strong enough to search inquire to grope an outlet from this cloud of doubt and find the open day of certainty it was the first of june yet the morning was overcast and chilly rain beat fast on my casement i heard the front door open and st john pass out looking through the window i saw him traverse the garden he took the way over the misty moors in the direction of whitcross there he would meet the coach in a few more hours i shall succeed you in that track cousin thought i i too have a coach to meet at whitcross i too have some to see and ask after in england before i depart for ever it wanted yet two hours of breakfast time i filled the interval in walking softly about my room and pondering the visitation which had given my plans their present bent i recalled that inward sensation i had experienced for i could recall it with all its unspeakable strangeness i recalled the voice i had heard again i questioned whence it came as vainly as before it seemed in me not in the external world i asked was it a mere nervous impression a delusion i could not conceive or believe it was more like an inspiration the wondrous shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations of paul and silas s prison it had opened the doors of the soul s cell and loosed its bands it had wakened it out of its sleep whence it sprang trembling listening aghast then vibrated thrice a cry on my startled ear and in my quaking heart and through my spirit which neither feared nor shook but exulted as if in joy over the success of one effort it had been privileged to make independent of the cumbrous body ere many days i said as i terminated my musings i will know something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me letters have proved of no avail personal inquiry shall replace them at breakfast i announced to diana and mary that i was going a journey and should be absent at least four days alone jane they asked yes it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom i had for some time been uneasy they might have said as i have no doubt they thought that they had believed me to be without any friends save them for indeed i had often said so but with their true natural delicacy they abstained from comment except that diana asked me if i was sure i was well enough to travel i looked very pale she observed i replied that nothing ailed me save anxiety of mind which i hoped soon to alleviate it was easy to make my further arrangements for i was troubled with no inquiries no surmises having once explained to them that i could not now be explicit about my plans they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the silence with which i pursued them according to me the privilege of free action i should under similar circumstances have accorded them i left moor house at three o clock p m and soon after four i stood at the foot of the sign post of whitcross waiting the arrival of the coach which was to take me to distant thornfield amidst the silence of those solitary roads and desert hills i heard it approach from a great distance it was the same vehicle whence a year ago i had alighted one summer evening on this very spot how desolate and hopeless and objectless it stopped as i beckoned i entered not now obliged to part with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation once more on the road to thornfield i felt like the messenger pigeon flying home it was a journey of six and thirty hours i had set out from whitcross on a tuesday afternoon and early on the succeeding thursday morning the coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn situated in the midst of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern north midland moors of morton met my eye like the lineaments of a once familiar face yes i knew the character of this landscape i was sure we were near my bourne how far is thornfield hall from here i asked of the ostler just two miles ma am across the fields my journey is closed i thought to myself i got out of the coach gave a box i had into the ostler s charge to be kept till i called for it paid my fare satisfied the coachman and was going the brightening day gleamed on the sign of the inn and i read in gilt letters the rochester arms my heart leapt up i was already on my master s very lands it fell again the thought struck it your master himself may be beyond the british channel for aught you know and then if he is at thornfield hall towards which you hasten who besides him is there his lunatic wife and you have nothing to do with him you dare not speak to him or seek his presence you have lost your labour you had better go no farther urged the monitor ask information of the people at the inn they can give you all you seek they can solve your doubts at once go up to that man and inquire if mr rochester be at home the suggestion was sensible and yet i could not force myself to act on it i so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair to prolong doubt was to prolong hope i might yet once more see the hall under the ray of her star there was the stile before me the very fields through which i had hurried blind deaf distracted with a revengeful fury tracking and scourging me on the morning i fled from thornfield ere i well knew what course i had resolved to take i was in the midst of them how fast i walked how i ran sometimes how i looked forward to catch the first view of the well known woods with what feelings i welcomed single trees i knew and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between them at last the woods rose the rookery clustered dark a loud cawing broke the morning stillness strange delight inspired me on i hastened another field crossed a lane threaded and there were the courtyard walls the back offices the house itself the rookery still hid my first view of it shall be in front i determined where its bold battlements will strike the eye nobly at once and where i can single out my master s very window perhaps he will be standing at it he rises early perhaps he is now walking in the orchard or on the pavement in front could i but see him but a moment surely in that case i should not be so mad as to run to him i cannot tell i am not certain and if i did what then god bless him what then who would be hurt by my once more tasting the life his glance can give me i rave perhaps at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the pyrenees or on the tideless sea of the south i had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard turned its angle there was a gate just there opening into the meadow between two stone pillars crowned by stone balls from behind one pillar i could peep round quietly at the full front of the mansion i advanced my head with precaution desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window blinds were yet drawn up battlements windows long front all from this sheltered station were at my command the crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while i took this survey i wonder what they thought they must have considered i was very careful and timid at first and that gradually i grew very bold and reckless a peep and then a long stare and then a departure from my niche and a straying out into the meadow and a sudden stop full in front of the great mansion and a protracted hardy gaze towards it what affectation of diffidence was this at first they might have demanded what stupid regardlessness now hear an illustration reader a lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank he wishes to catch a glimpse of her fair face without waking her he steals softly over the grass careful to make no sound he pauses fancying she has stirred he withdraws not for worlds would he be seen all is still he again advances he bends above her a light veil rests on her features he lifts it bends lower now his eyes anticipate the vision of beauty warm and blooming and lovely in rest how hurried was their first glance but how they fix how he starts how he suddenly and vehemently clasps in both arms the form he dared not a moment since touch with his finger how he calls aloud a name and drops his burden and gazes on it wildly he thus grasps and cries and gazes because he no longer fears to waken by any sound he can utter by any movement he can make he thought his love slept sweetly he finds she is stone dead i looked with timorous joy towards a stately house i saw a blackened ruin no need to cower behind a gate post indeed to peep up at chamber lattices fearing life was astir behind them no need to listen for doors opening to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel walk the lawn the grounds were trodden and waste the portal yawned void the front was as i had once seen it in a dream but a well like wall very high and very fragile looking perforated with paneless windows no roof no battlements no chimneys all had crashed in and there was the silence of death about it the solitude of a lonesome wild no wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received an answer as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle the grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the hall had fallen by conflagration but how kindled what story belonged to this disaster what loss besides mortar and marble and wood work had followed upon it had life been wrecked as well as property if so whose dreadful question there was no one here to answer it not even dumb sign mute token in wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated interior i gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late occurrence winter snows i thought had drifted through that void arch winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements for amidst the drenched piles of rubbish spring had cherished vegetation grass and weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters and oh where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck in what land under what auspices my eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower near the gates and i asked is he with damer de rochester sharing the shelter of his narrow marble house some answer must be had to these questions i could find it nowhere but at the inn and thither ere long i returned the host himself brought my breakfast into the parlour i requested him to shut the door and sit down i had some questions to ask him but when he complied i scarcely knew how to begin such horror had i of the possible answers and yet the spectacle of desolation i had just left prepared me in a measure for a tale of misery the host was a respectable looking middle aged man you know thornfield hall of course i managed to say at last yes ma am i lived there once did you not in my time i thought you are a stranger to me i was the late mr rochester s butler he added the late i seem to have received with full force the blow i had been trying to evade the late i gasped is he dead i mean the present gentleman mr edward s father he explained i breathed again my blood resumed its flow fully assured by these words that mr edward my mr rochester god bless him wherever he was was at least alive was in short the present gentleman gladdening words it seemed i could hear all that was to come whatever the disclosures might be with comparative tranquillity since he was not in the grave i could bear i thought to learn that he was at the antipodes is mr rochester living at thornfield hall now i asked knowing of course what the answer would be but yet desirous of deferring the direct question as to where he really was no ma am oh no no one is living there i suppose you are a stranger in these parts or you would have heard what happened last autumn thornfield hall is quite a ruin it was burnt down just about harvest time a dreadful calamity such an immense quantity of valuable property destroyed hardly any of the furniture could be saved the fire broke out at dead of night and before the engines arrived from millcote the building was one mass of flame it was a terrible spectacle i witnessed it myself at dead of night i muttered yes that was ever the hour of fatality at thornfield was it known how it originated i demanded they guessed ma am they guessed indeed i should say it was ascertained beyond a doubt you are not perhaps aware he continued edging his chair a little nearer the table and speaking low that there was a lady a a lunatic kept in the house i have heard something of it she was kept in very close confinement ma am people even for some years was not absolutely certain of her existence no one saw her they only knew by rumour that such a person was at the hall and who or what she was it was difficult to conjecture they said mr edward had brought her from abroad and some believed she had been his mistress but a queer thing happened a year since a very queer thing i feared now to hear my own story i endeavoured to recall him to the main fact and this lady this lady ma am he answered turned out to be mr rochester s wife the discovery was brought about in the strangest way there was a young lady a governess at the hall that mr rochester fell in but the fire i suggested i m coming to that ma am that mr edward fell in love with the servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was he was after her continually they used to watch him servants will you know ma am and he set store on her past everything for all nobody but him thought her so very handsome she was a little small thing they say almost like a child i never saw her myself but i ve heard leah the house maid tell of her leah liked her well enough mr rochester was about forty and this governess not twenty and you see when gentlemen of his age fall in love with girls they are often like as if they were bewitched well he would marry her you shall tell me this part of the story another time i said but now i have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire was it suspected that this lunatic mrs rochester had any hand in it you ve hit it ma am it s quite certain that it was her and nobody but her that set it going she had a woman to take care of her called mrs poole an able woman in her line and very trustworthy but for one fault a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons she kept a private bottle of gin by her and now and then took a drop over much it is excusable for she had a hard life of it but still it was dangerous for when mrs poole was fast asleep after the gin and water the mad lady who was as cunning as a witch would take the keys out of her pocket let herself out of her chamber and go roaming about the house doing any wild mischief that came into her head they say she had nearly burnt her husband in his bed once but i don t know about that however on this night she set fire first to the hangings of the room next her own and then she got down to a lower storey and made her way to the chamber that had been the governess s she was like as if she knew somehow how matters had gone on and had a spite at her and she kindled the bed there but there was nobody sleeping in it fortunately the governess had run away two months before and for all mr rochester sought her as if she had been the most precious thing he had in the world he never could hear a word of her and he grew savage quite savage on his disappointment he never was a wild man but he got dangerous after he lost her he would be alone too he sent mrs fairfax the housekeeper away to her friends at a distance but he did it handsomely for he settled an annuity on her for life and she deserved it she was a very good woman miss ad le a ward he had was put to school he broke off acquaintance with all the gentry and shut himself up like a hermit at the hall what did he not leave england leave england bless you no he would not cross the door stones of the house except at night when he walked just like a ghost about the grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses which it is my opinion he had for a more spirited bolder keener gentleman than he was before that midge of a governess crossed him you never saw ma am he was not a man given to wine or cards or racing as some are and he was not so very handsome but he had a courage and a will of his own if ever man had i knew him from a boy you see and for my part i have often wished that miss eyre had been sunk in the sea before she came to thornfield hall then mr rochester was at home when the fire broke out yes indeed was he and he went up to the attics when all was burning above and below and got the servants out of their beds and helped them down himself and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell and then they called out to him that she was on the roof where she was standing waving her arms above the battlements and shouting out till they could hear her a mile off i saw her and heard her with my own eyes she was a big woman and had long black hair we could see it streaming against the flames as she stood i witnessed and several more witnessed mr rochester ascend through the sky light on to the roof we heard him call bertha we saw him approach her and then ma am she yelled and gave a spring and the next minute she lay smashed on the pavement dead dead ay dead as the stones on which her brains and blood were scattered good god you may well say so ma am it was frightful he shuddered and afterwards i urged well ma am afterwards the house was burnt to the ground there are only some bits of walls standing now were any other lives lost no perhaps it would have been better if there had what do you mean poor mr edward he ejaculated i little thought ever to have seen it some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first marriage secret and wanting to take another wife while he had one living but i pity him for my part you said he was alive i exclaimed yes yes he is alive but many think he had better be dead why how my blood was again running cold where is he i demanded is he in england ay ay he s in england he can t get out of england i fancy he s a fixture now what agony was this and the man seemed resolved to protract it he is stone blind he said at last yes he is stone blind is mr edward i had dreaded worse i had dreaded he was mad i summoned strength to ask what had caused this calamity it was all his own courage and a body may say his kindness in a way ma am he wouldn t leave the house till every one else was out before him as he came down the great staircase at last after mrs rochester had flung herself from the battlements there was a great crash all fell he was taken out from under the ruins alive but sadly hurt a beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly but one eye was knocked out and one hand so crushed that mr carter the surgeon had to amputate it directly the other eye inflamed he lost the sight of that also he is now helpless indeed blind and a cripple where is he where does he now live at ferndean a manor house on a farm he has about thirty miles off quite a desolate spot who is with him old john and his wife he would have none else he is quite broken down they say have you any sort of conveyance we have a chaise ma am a very handsome chaise let it be got ready instantly and if your post boy can drive me to ferndean before dark this day i ll pay both you and him twice the hire you usually demand embed,"['flow', 'nurse', 'uneasy', 'trust', 'asleep', 'drop', 'kindness', 'niche', 'south', 'terminate', 'race', 'secret', 'grey', 'mile', 'mad', 'scatter', 'valuable',

york dined at seven and the habit of after dinner calls though derided in archer s set still generally prevailed as the young man strolled up fifth avenue from waverley place the long thoroughfare was deserted but for a group of carriages standing before the reggie chiverses where there was a dinner for the duke and the occasional figure of an elderly gentleman in heavy overcoat and muffler ascending a brownstone doorstep and disappearing into a gas lit hall thus as archer crossed washington square he remarked that old mr du lac was calling on his cousins the dagonets and turning down the corner of west tenth street he saw mr skipworth of his own firm obviously bound on a visit to the miss lannings a little farther up fifth avenue beaufort appeared on his doorstep darkly projected against a blaze of light descended to his private brougham and rolled away to a mysterious and probably unmentionable destination it was not an opera night and no one was giving a party so that beaufort s outing was undoubtedly of a clandestine nature archer connected it in his mind with a little house beyond lexington avenue in which beribboned window curtains and flower boxes had recently appeared and before whose newly painted door the canary coloured brougham of miss fanny ring was frequently seen to wait beyond the small and slippery pyramid which composed mrs archer s world lay the almost unmapped quarter inhabited by artists musicians and people who wrote these scattered fragments of humanity had never shown any desire to be amalgamated with the social structure in spite of odd ways they were said to be for the most part quite respectable but they preferred to keep to themselves medora manson in her prosperous days had inaugurated a literary salon but it had soon died out owing to the reluctance of the literary to frequent it others had made the same attempt and there was a household of blenkers an intense and voluble mother and three blowsy daughters who imitated her where one met edwin booth and patti and william winter and the new shakespearian actor george rignold and some of the magazine editors and musical and literary critics mrs archer and her group felt a certain timidity concerning these persons they were odd they were uncertain they had things one didn t know about in the background of their lives and minds literature and art were deeply respected in the archer set and mrs archer was always at pains to tell her children how much more agreeable and cultivated society had been when it included such figures as washington irving fitz greene halleck and the poet of the culprit fay the most celebrated authors of that generation had been gentlemen perhaps the unknown persons who succeeded them had gentlemanly sentiments but their origin their appearance their hair their intimacy with the stage and the opera made any old new york criterion inapplicable to them when i was a girl mrs archer used to say we knew everybody between the battery and canal street and only the people one knew had carriages it was perfectly easy to place any one then now one can t tell and i prefer not to try only old catherine mingott with her absence of moral prejudices and almost parvenu indifference to the subtler distinctions might have bridged the abyss but she had never opened a book or looked at a picture and cared for music only because it reminded her of gala nights at the italiens in the days of her triumph at the tuileries possibly beaufort who was her match in daring would have succeeded in bringing about a fusion but his grand house and silk stockinged footmen were an obstacle to informal sociability moreover he was as illiterate as old mrs mingott and considered fellows who wrote as the mere paid purveyors of rich men s pleasures and no one rich enough to influence his opinion had ever questioned it newland archer had been aware of these things ever since he could remember and had accepted them as part of the structure of his universe he knew that there were societies where painters and poets and novelists and men of science and even great actors were as sought after as dukes he had often pictured to himself what it would have been to live in the intimacy of drawing rooms dominated by the talk of merimee whose lettres a une inconnue was one of his inseparables of thackeray browning or william morris but such things were inconceivable in new york and unsettling to think of archer knew most of the fellows who wrote the musicians and the painters he met them at the century or at the little musical and theatrical clubs that were beginning to come into existence he enjoyed them there and was bored with them at the blenkers where they were mingled with fervid and dowdy women who passed them about like captured curiosities and even after his most exciting talks with ned winsett he always came away with the feeling that if his world was small so was theirs and that the only way to enlarge either was to reach a stage of manners where they would naturally merge he was reminded of this by trying to picture the society in which the countess olenska had lived and suffered and also perhaps tasted mysterious joys he remembered with what amusement she had told him that her grandmother mingott and the wellands objected to her living in a bohemian quarter given over to people who wrote it was not the peril but the poverty that her family disliked but that shade escaped her and she supposed they considered literature compromising she herself had no fears of it and the books scattered about her drawing room a part of the house in which books were usually supposed to be out of place though chiefly works of fiction had whetted archer s interest with such new names as those of paul bourget huysmans and the goncourt brothers ruminating on these things as he approached her door he was once more conscious of the curious way in which she reversed his values and of the need of thinking himself into conditions incredibly different from any that he knew if he were to be of use in her present difficulty nastasia opened the door smiling mysteriously on the bench in the hall lay a sable lined overcoat a folded opera hat of dull silk with a gold j b on the lining and a white silk muffler there was no mistaking the fact that these costly articles were the property of julius beaufort archer was angry so angry that he came near scribbling a word on his card and going away then he remembered that in writing to madame olenska he had been kept by excess of discretion from saying that he wished to see her privately he had therefore no one but himself to blame if she had opened her doors to other visitors and he entered the drawing room with the dogged determination to make beaufort feel himself in the way and to outstay him the banker stood leaning against the mantelshelf which was draped with an old embroidery held in place by brass candelabra containing church candies of yellowish wax he had thrust his chest out supporting his shoulders against the mantel and resting his weight on one large patent leather foot as archer entered he was smiling and looking down on his hostess who sat on a sofa placed at right angles to the chimney a table banked with flowers formed a screen behind it and against the orchids and azaleas which the young man recognised as tributes from the beaufort hot houses madame olenska sat half reclined her head propped on a hand and her wide sleeve leaving the arm bare to the elbow it was usual for ladies who received in the evenings to wear what were called simple dinner dresses a close fitting armour of whale boned silk slightly open in the neck with lace ruffles filling in the crack and tight sleeves with a flounce uncovering just enough wrist to show an etruscan gold bracelet or a velvet band but madame olenska heedless of tradition was attired in a long robe of red velvet bordered about the chin and down the front with glossy black fur archer remembered on his last visit to paris seeing a portrait by the new painter carolus duran whose pictures were the sensation of the salon in which the lady wore one of these bold sheath like robes with her chin nestling in fur there was something perverse and provocative in the notion of fur worn in the evening in a heated drawing room and in the combination of a muffled throat and bare arms but the effect was undeniably pleasing lord love us three whole days at skuytercliff beaufort was saying in his loud sneering voice as archer entered you d better take all your furs and a hot water bottle why is the house so cold she asked holding out her left hand to archer in a way mysteriously suggesting that she expected him to kiss it no but the missus is said beaufort nodding carelessly to the young man but i thought her so kind she came herself to invite me granny says i must certainly go granny would of course and i say it s a shame you re going to miss the little oyster supper i d planned for you at delmonico s next sunday with campanini and scalchi and a lot of jolly people she looked doubtfully from the banker to archer ah that does tempt me except the other evening at mrs struthers s i ve not met a single artist since i ve been here what kind of artists i know one or two painters very good fellows that i could bring to see you if you d allow me said archer boldly painters are there painters in new york asked beaufort in a tone implying that there could be none since he did not buy their pictures and madame olenska said to archer with her grave smile that would be charming but i was really thinking of dramatic artists singers actors musicians my husband s house was always full of them she said the words my husband as if no sinister associations were connected with them and in a tone that seemed almost to sigh over the lost delights of her married life archer looked at her perplexedly wondering if it were lightness or dissimulation that enabled her to touch so easily on the past at the very moment when she was risking her reputation in order to break with it i do think she went on addressing both men that the imprevu adds to one s enjoyment it s perhaps a mistake to see the same people every day it s confoundedly dull anyhow new york is dying of dullness beaufort grumbled and when i try to liven it up for you you go back on me come think better of it sunday is your last chance for campanini leaves next week for baltimore and philadelphia and i ve a private room and a steinway and they ll sing all night for me how delicious may i think it over and write to you tomorrow morning she spoke amiably yet with the least hint of dismissal in her voice beaufort evidently felt it and being unused to dismissals stood staring at her with an obstinate line between his eyes why not now it s too serious a question to decide at this late hour do you call it late she returned his glance coolly yes because i have still to talk business with mr archer for a little while ah beaufort snapped there was no appeal from her tone and with a slight shrug he recovered his composure took her hand which he kissed with a practised air and calling out from the threshold i say newland if you can persuade the countess to stop in town of course you re included in the supper left the room with his heavy important step for a moment archer fancied that mr letterblair must have told her of his coming but the irrelevance of her next remark made him change his mind you know painters then you live in their milieu she asked her eyes full of interest oh not exactly i don t know that the arts have a milieu here any of them they re more like a very thinly settled outskirt but you care for such things immensely when i m in paris or london i never miss an exhibition i try to keep up she looked down at the tip of the little satin boot that peeped from her long draperies i used to care immensely too my life was full of such things but now i want to try not to you want to try not to yes i want to cast off all my old life to become just like everybody else here archer reddened you ll never be like everybody else he said she raised her straight eyebrows a little ah don t say that if you knew how i hate to be different her face had grown as sombre as a tragic mask she leaned forward clasping her knee in her thin hands and looking away from him into remote dark distances i want to get away from it all she insisted he waited a moment and cleared his throat i know mr letterblair has told me ah that s the reason i ve come he asked me to you see i m in the firm she looked slightly surprised and then her eyes brightened you mean you can manage it for me i can talk to you instead of mr letterblair oh that will be so much easier her tone touched him and his confidence grew with his self satisfaction he perceived that she had spoken of business to beaufort simply to get rid of him and to have routed beaufort was something of a triumph i am here to talk about it he repeated she sat silent her head still propped by the arm that rested on the back of the sofa her face looked pale and extinguished as if dimmed by the rich red of her dress she struck archer of a sudden as a pathetic and even pitiful figure now we re coming to hard facts he thought conscious in himself of the same instinctive recoil that he had so often criticised in his mother and her contemporaries how little practice he had had in dealing with unusual situations their very vocabulary was unfamiliar to him and seemed to belong to fiction and the stage in face of what was coming he felt as awkward and embarrassed as a boy after a pause madame olenska broke out with unexpected vehemence i want to be free i want to wipe out all the past i understand that her face warmed then you ll help me first he hesitated perhaps i ought to know a little more she seemed surprised you know about my husband my life with him he made a sign of assent well then what more is there in this country are such things tolerated i m a protestant our church does not forbid divorce in such cases certainly not they were both silent again and archer felt the spectre of count olenski s letter grimacing hideously between them the letter filled only half a page and was just what he had described it to be in speaking of it to mr letterblair the vague charge of an angry blackguard but how much truth was behind it only count olenski s wife could tell i ve looked through the papers you gave to mr letterblair he said at length well can there be anything more abominable no she changed her position slightly screening her eyes with her lifted hand of course you know archer continued that if your husband chooses to fight the case as he threatens to yes he can say things things that might be unpl might be disagreeable to you say them publicly so that they would get about and harm you even if if i mean no matter how unfounded they were she paused for a long interval so long that not wishing to keep his eyes on her shaded face he had time to imprint on his mind the exact shape of her other hand the one on her knee and every detail of the three rings on her fourth and fifth fingers among which he noticed a wedding ring did not appear what harm could such accusations even if he made them publicly do me here it was on his lips to exclaim my poor child far more harm than anywhere else instead he answered in a voice that sounded in his ears like mr letterblair s new york society is a very small world compared with the one you ve lived in and it s ruled in spite of appearances by a few people with well rather old fashioned ideas she said nothing and he continued our ideas about marriage and divorce are particularly old fashioned our legislation favours divorce our social customs don t never well not if the woman however injured however irreproachable has appearances in the least degree against her has exposed herself by any unconventional action to to offensive insinuations she drooped her head a little lower and he waited again intensely hoping for a flash of indignation or at least a brief cry of denial none came a little travelling clock ticked purringly at her elbow and a log broke in two and sent up a shower of sparks the whole hushed and brooding room seemed to be waiting silently with archer yes she murmured at length that s what my family tell me he winced a little it s not unnatural our family she corrected herself and archer coloured for you ll be my cousin soon she continued gently i hope so and you take their view he stood up at this wandered across the room stared with void eyes at one of the pictures against the old red damask and came back irresolutely to her side how could he say yes if what your husband hints is true or if you ve no way of disproving it sincerely she interjected as he was about to speak he looked down into the fire sincerely then what should you gain that would compensate for the possibility the certainty of a lot of beastly talk but my freedom is that nothing it flashed across him at that instant that the charge in the letter was true and that she hoped to marry the partner of her guilt how was he to tell her that if she really cherished such a plan the laws of the state were inexorably opposed to it the mere suspicion that the thought was in her mind made him feel harshly and impatiently toward her but aren t you as free as air as it is he returned who can touch you mr letterblair tells me the financial question has been settled oh yes she said indifferently well then is it worth while to risk what may be infinitely disagreeable and painful think of the newspapers their vileness it s all stupid and narrow and unjust but one can t make over society no she acquiesced and her tone was so faint and desolate that he felt a sudden remorse for his own hard thoughts the individual in such cases is nearly always sacrificed to what is supposed to be the collective interest people cling to any convention that keeps the family together protects the children if there are any he rambled on pouring out all the stock phrases that rose to his lips in his intense desire to cover over the ugly reality which her silence seemed to have laid bare since she would not or could not say the one word that would have cleared the air his wish was not to let her feel that he was trying to probe into her secret better keep on the surface in the prudent old new york way than risk uncovering a wound he could not heal it s my business you know he went on to help you to see these things as the people who are fondest of you see them the mingotts the wellands the van der luydens all your friends and relations if i didn t show you honestly how they judge such questions it wouldn t be fair of me would it he spoke insistently almost pleading with her in his eagerness to cover up that yawning silence she said slowly no it wouldn t be fair the fire had crumbled down to greyness and one of the lamps made a gurgling appeal for attention madame olenska rose wound it up and returned to the fire but without resuming her seat her remaining on her feet seemed to signify that there was nothing more for either of them to say and archer stood up also very well i will do what you wish she said abruptly the blood rushed to his forehead and taken aback by the suddenness of her surrender he caught her two hands awkwardly in his i i do want to help you he said you do help me good night my cousin he bent and laid his lips on her hands which were cold and lifeless she drew them away and he turned to the door found his coat and hat under the faint gas light of the hall and plunged out into the winter night bursting with the belated eloquence of

medicine confirms it each year between one and two dozen adult us males are admitted to ers after having castrated themselves with kitchen tools usually sometimes wire cutters in answer to the obvious question surviving patients most often report that their sexual urges had become a source of intolerable conflict and anxiety the desire for perfect release and the real world impossibility of perfect whenever you want it release had together produced a tension they could no longer stand it is to the testosteronically afflicted males whose cases have been documented in the past two years that your correspondents wish to dedicate this article and to those tormented souls considering autocastration in we wish to say stop stay your hand hold off with those kitchen utensils and or wire cutters because we believe we may have found an alternative every spring the academy of motion picture arts and sciences presents awards for outstanding achievement in all aspects of mainstream cinema these are the academy awards mainstream cinema is a major industry in the united states and so are the academy awards the aas notorious commercialism and hypocrisy disgust many of the millions and millions and millions of viewers who tune in during prime time to watch the presentations it is not a coincidence that the oscars ceremony is held during tv s sweeps week we pretty much all tune in despite the grotesquerie of watching an industry congratulate itself on its pretense that it s still an art form of hearing people in gowns invoke lush clich s of surprise and humility scripted by publicists etc the whole cynical postmodern deal but we all still seem to watch to care even though the hypocrisy hurts even though opening grosses and marketing strategies are now bigger news than the movies themselves even though cannes and sundance have become nothing more than enterprise zones but the truth is that there s no more real joy about it all anymore worse there seems to be this enormous unspoken conspiracy where we all pretend that there s still joy that we think it s funny when bob dole does a visa ad and gorbachev shills for pizza hut that the whole mainstream celebrity culture is rushing to cash in and all the while congratulating itself on pretending not to cash in underneath it all though we know the whole thing sucks your correspondents humbly offer an alternative every january the least pretentious city in america hosts the annual avn awards the avn stands for adult video news which is sort of the variety of the us porn industry this thick beautifully designed magazine costs per issue is about percent ads and is clearly targeted at adult video retailers its circulation is appr though the sub line vagaries of entertainment accounting are legendary it is universally acknowledged that the us adult film industry at billion in annual sales rentals cable charges and video masturbation booth revenues is an even larger and more efficient moneymaking machine than legitimate mainstream american cinema the latter s annual gross commonly estimated at billion the us adult industry is centered in la s san fernando valley just over the mountains from hollywood some insiders like to refer to the adult industry as hollywood s evil twin others as the mainstream s big red son it is no accident that adult video news a slick expensive periodical whose articles are really more like infomercials and its yearly awards both came into being in the early s after all saw the genesis of vcrs and home video rentals which have done for the adult industry pretty much what tv did for pro football from the press release issued by avn visitable also at www avn com the nominations for the th annual avn awards were announced today this year s awards show commemorating avn s th anniversary celebrates history sic awards will be presented in a record categories over a two night period the adult industry released nearly adult releases sic in including over new releases non compilation avn reviewed every new release in every categroy sic this past year logging over sex scenes by comparison last year there were approximately films eligible for the academy awards that these voters sic meaning different voters from the avn voters presumably were required to see avn had to watch more than times the amount of releases in order to develop these nominations usage and repetition sic though divided by is indeed over from the acceptance speech of mr tom byron saturday january caesars forum ballroom caesars palace hotel and casino complex las vegas nv upon winning avn

upon winning avn s best supporting actress award for her role in rob black s miscreants jesus which one is this for miscreants jesus that s another one where i read the script and said oh shit i am going to go to hell laughter cheers but that s okay cause all my friends ll be there too huge wave of laughter cheers applause from the inter award banter of mr bobby slayton professional comedian and master of ceremonies for the avnas i know i m looking good though like younger cause i started using this special grecian formula every time i find a gray hair i fuck my wife in the ass no laughter scattered groans fuck you that s a great joke fuck you bobby slayton a gravelly voiced dice clay knockoff who kept introducing every female performer as the woman i m going to cut my dick off for and who astounded all the marginal print journalists in attendance with both his unfunniness and his resemblance to every apartment complex coke dealer we d ever met is mercifully absent from the awards gala the emcee is one robert schimmel alumnus of in living color and a howard stern regular schimmel looks like a depraved deeply tan wallace shawn and is no less coarse than b slayton but a lot better he does a pantomime of someone attempting intercourse with a love doll he s been too lazy to blow up all the way he contrasts the woeful paucity of his own ejaculate with the concussive orgasms of certain well known male performers comparing these men s ejaculations to automatic lawn sprinklers and doing an eerie sonic impression of same all of s marginal print journalists are together at table at the very back of the ballroom most of these reporters are from the sorts of men s magazines that sit shrinkwrapped behind the cash registers of convenience stores and they are a worldly and jaded crew indeed but schimmel gets a couple of them whose noms de guerre are harold hecuba and dick filth laughing so uproariously that people at the anabolic video table nearby keep looking over in annoyance at one point during a routine on premature ejaculation dick filth actually chokes on a california roll but all this is saturday night the main event and there are a whole lot of festivities preceding saturday s climax the adult industry is vulgar would anyone disagree one of the avn awards categories is best anal themed feature another is best overall marketing campaign company image irresistible a winner in several categories has been spelled irresistable in adult video news for fifteen straight years the industry s not only vulgar it s predictably vulgar all the clich s are true the typical porn producer really is the ugly little man with a bad toupee and a pinkie ring the size of a rolaids the typical porn director really is the guy who uses the word class as a noun to mean refinement the typical porn starlet really is the lady in lycra eveningwear with tattoos all down her arms who s both smoking and chewing gum while telling journalists how grateful she is to wadcutter productions ltd for footing her breast enlargement bill and meaning it the whole avn awards weekend comprises what mr dick filth calls an irony free zone but of course we should keep in mind that vulgar has many dictionary definitions and that only a couple of these have to do w lewdness or bad taste at root vulgar just means popular on a mass scale it is the semantic opposite of pretentious or snobby it is humility with a comb over it is nielsen ratings and barnum s axiom and the real bottom line it is big big business thirty four year old porn actor cal jammer killed himself in starlets shauna grant nancy kelly alex jordan and savannah have all killed themselves in the last decade savannah and jordan received avn s best new starlet awards in and respectively savannah killed herself

are one more spectacle way more tourists and conventioneers recognize the starlets than you d expect double takes all over the hotel even just standing around or putting coins in a slot machine the performers become a prime attraction las vegas doesn t miss a trick the annual avn awards are always scheduled to coincide with the international consumer electronics show a k a ces which this year runs from through january the ces is a very big deal it s like a combination convention and talent show for the best and brightest in the world of consumer tech steve forbes is here and dss s thomson sun microsystems is using this year s ces to launch its personaljava bill gates gives a packed house speech on saturday morning major players from tv cable and merchandising host a panel on the short term viability of hdtv a forum on the problem of product returns by disgruntled customers seats and is sro the ces as a whole is bigger than your correspondents hometowns it s spread out over four different hotels and has booths with everything from the first ever full text message pager in a wristwatch to the world s premier self heating home satellite dish the snow and ice solution but far and away the ces s most popular venue with total attendance well over every year is what is called the adult software exhibition despite the fact that the ces itself treats the adult tradeshow kind of like the crazy relative in the family and keeps it way out in what used to be the parking garage of the sands hotel this facility a serious bus ride from all the other ces sites is an enormous windowless all cement space that during show hours manages to induce both agoraphobia and claustrophobia a big sign says you have to be to get in the median age inside is almost all males nearly everyone wearing some sort of conventioneer s nametag every production company in the adult industry from anabolic to zane has a booth here the really big companies have booths that are sprawling and multidisplay and more like small strip malls a lot of porn s top female performers are contract players exclusive vendors to one particular production company and one reason why a lot of the starlets seem kind of tired and cranky by saturday night s awards gala is that they will have spent much of the previous hours at their companies ces booths on their feet all day in vertiginous heels signing autographs and posing for pictures and pressing all manner of flesh the best way to describe the sonic environment at the ces is imagine that the apocalypse took the form of a cocktail party male fans move through the fractal maze of booths in groups of three or more their expressions tend to be those of junior high boys at a peephole an expression that looks pretty surreal on a face with jowls and no hairline some among them are video retailers most are not most are just hard core fans the industry s breath and bread a lot of them not only recognize but seem to know the names stage names and curricula vitae of almost all the female performers it takes an average of two hours and twelve minutes to traverse the adult ces expo counting an average of four delays for getting lost after a

harold hecuba d filth and a porn executive dressed entirely in campbell nightwatch plaid are smoking cigars and keep holding their cigars up together and comparing the ash to see which one has the cleanest burn a lot of the industry males and even some of the starlets are also smoking cigars is definitely the year of the cigar the starlets are all in either extremely formal cocktail dresses or else abbreviated latex vinyl lycra ensembles heels are uniformly sharp and ultrahigh some of the starlets are so heavily made up they look embalmed they tend to have complexly coiffed hair that looks really good from feet away but on closer inspection is dry and dead someone who is either sometime performer jeff marton or bizarro sleaze filmmaker gregory dark is doing sleight of hand tricks with

major league pretty she looks like a slightly debauched cindy crawford and an oversize monitor suspended from the ceiling over the vivid area plays clips of her scantily clad and dancing amid dry ice fumes there s a berm of boxed videos on the floor by the counter and a huge man with a visor and handheld credit card machine on taylor s right flank as she greets each fan like a long lost relative according to dick filth taylor is both a genuinely nice person and a consummate pro the booth for xplor media a company known for its southern belles video series and orgy for world peace website is arresting because all the execs at xplor seem to be under and the booth s atmosphere is that of a fraternity party in its third straight day one young bald guy is unconscious in a fetal position on the counter and some wag has glued all sorts of feathers and flaccid plastic two headed dildoish things to his skull xplor s owner auteurs are two brothers trust fund babies from a connecticut suburb of nyc their names are farrel and moffitt timlake farrel who wears twelve hole doc martens and cargo pants and what s either a very light parka or very heavy sweatshirt with a hood that stays up at all times is a particular cause c l bre at the ces because he s apparently a friend of the two guys who do south park and these guys are rumored to be in vegas and to possess tickets to saturday s awards banquet everyone without exception is sweating at all but a few of the booths contract starlets treat the fans with the same absent rigid faced courtesy that flight attendants and restaurant hostesses tend to use you can tell how bored the performers are by the way their faces light up when they see someone they know well over half of the industry s current superstars are in this huge room the infamous t t boy is here standing alone with his trademark glower the boy who is rumored to bring a semiautomatic pistol with him to the set and who was featured in a new yorker article that was full of lines like a porn shoot is an intricately delineated ecology mr vince vouyer sic is on hand as are seth gecko jake steed serenity missy and nick east here is the ageless randy west who looks just the way a surfer would look if that surfer were also a mob enforcer with his perennial tan and hair like frozen surf mr jon dough winner of avn s coveted best actor video statuette in both and alternates between various booths wearing his customary expression of having psychologically evolved to the point where he s so incredibly cool and detached that life is one long yawn here also is mark davis far and away the most handsome of the current males a near double for gregory harrison of the old trapper john series except for davis s ultrashort psych patient haircut plus goatee and year veteran joey silvera is at this year s ces though mostly in his capacity as an auteur silvera now directs evil angel s popular butt row video series following the lead of pioneers like john leslie and paul thomas most of today s top male stars now also direct and per the store boxes present their own line of videos e g tom byron s cumback pussy series jon dough s dirty stories the eye popping rocco siffredi s various european cities by night line etc the so and so presents series seems to be an industry trend like cigars and goatees it is difficult to describe how it feels to gaze at living human beings whom you ve seen perform in hard core porn to shake the hand of a man whose precise erectile size angle and vasculature are known to you that strange i think we ve met before sensation one feels upon seeing any celebrity in the flesh is here both intensified and twisted it feels intensely twisted to see reigning industry queen jenna jameson chilling out at the vivid booth in jordaches and a latex bustier and to know already that she has a tattoo of a sundered valentine with the tagline heart breaker on her right buttock and a tiny hairless mole just left of her anus to watch peter north try to get a cigar lit and to have that sight backlit by memories of his artilleryesque ejaculations to have seen these strangers faces in orgasm that most unguarded and purely neural of expressions the one so vulnerable that for centuries you basically had to marry a person to get to see it this weirdness may account for some of the complex emotional intercourse taking place between the performers and fans at the adult ces the patrons may leer and elbow one another at a distance but by the time the men get to the front of the line and face the living incarnation of their vcr s fantasy babe most of them turn into quivering goggle eyed schoolboys sheepish and salivaless and damp the same thing evidently happens at the hundreds of strip clubs all over the country where porn starlets appear as featured dancers for five figures a week according to filth and do photos and autographs after the show most of these guys become incredibly nervous when i come up to them veteran starlet shane has explained i ll put my arms around a guy and his whole body will be trembling they pretty much do whatever i tell them to do the whole industry now has this oddly reversed equation the consumers are the ones who seem ashamed or shy while the performers are cocky and smooth and percent pro it is no longer the s and the meese commission mentality that led to a major crackdown on video porn is long gone federal task forces and pta outrage are now focused on the internet and kiddie porn but today s adult industry is still hypersensitive about what it perceives as fascist attacks on its first amendment freedoms a specially prepared trailer now runs before many higher end adult videos right between the legal disclaimer on the product s compliance with or exemption from u s c and ads for phone services like fuck against shots of flowing flags and the lincoln memorial a voiceover says stuff like censorship goes against our bill of rights and the founding principles of this country it is an attempt on the part of the government to legislate morality and to stifle free expression this new legal morality is dangerous to all americans vote for those who believe in limiting government intrusion into your personal affairs vote against government control of your life and home vote against censorship only you the people can keep the american ideal intact these trailers always say they re sponsored by either the adult video association or something called the free speech coalition both organizations and the extent to which the two are separate is unclear are basically industry pacs porn in other words has taken the political lessons of the s to heart it is now a hard lobbying political force no less than gm or rjr nabisco feminists of all different stripe oppose the adult industry for reasons having to do with pornography s putative effects on women their arguments are well known and in some respects persuasive but certain antiporn arguments in the s are now centered on adult entertainment s alleged effects on the men who consume it some masculists believe that a lot of men get addicted to video porn in a way that causes grievous psychic harm example an essayist named david mura has a little book called a male grief notes on pornography and addiction which is a bit new agey but interesting in places e g at the essence of pornography is the image of flesh used as a drug a way of numbing psychic pain but this drug lasts only as long as the man stares at the image in pornographic perception each gesture each word each image is read first and foremost through sexuality love or tenderness pity or compassion become subsumed by and are made subservient to a greater deity a more powerful force the addict to pornography desires to be blinded to live in a dream those in the thrall of pornography try to eliminate from their consciousness the world outside pornography and this includes everything from their family and friends or last sunday s sermon to the political situation in the middle east in engaging in such elimination the viewer reduces himself he becomes stupid this kind of stuff might sound a little out there maybe until one observes the eerie similarity between the eyes of males in strip clubs or stroke parlors and the eyes of people in their fifth hour of pumping silver dollars into the slot machines of the sands casino or maybe until one s seen firsthand the odd kind of shock on the faces of ces patrons seeing performers now in the flesh complete with chewing gum and chin pimples and all the human stuff you never see never want to see in films maybe just a little bit more here on the whole scene at the adult ces which is a lot more of a rub elbows type venue than the stylized awards ceremony is going to end up being mr harold hecuba is deep in conversation with a marginal porn producer about one of his performers being sidelined with something called a prolapsed sphincter which condition yr corresps decline to follow up on in any way we are standing just west of a staff writer for digital horizons who s dropped by to scope out the legendary scene in here again this year and is telling two presumed other tech writers that being around porn people always makes him feel like he s been somehow astrally projected onto a cocktail napkin it is also roughly now that ms jasmin st claire is making an appearance at the impressive media booth in order to spell the starlet behind the counter who is limping to the booth s rear area she i e the limping starlet has reportedly had to be sprayed with silicon to fit into her pants the crowd at the impressive media venue immediately starts to enlarge jasmin st claire is wearing a red vinyl jacket and miniskirt ensemble a porn starlet entering any kind of room or area has a distinctive energy about her you turn your head to look even if you don t seem to want to it s like watching a figure from a pinball machine illustration or high concept comic book step out into d and head your way it turns out really to be possible to feel as though your eyeballs are protruding slightly from their sockets what makes the whole thing so weird is that jasmin st claire isn t even all that pretty at least not today her hair is dyed black in that cheap unreal goth way and she is so incredibly heavily made up that she looks like a crow she is also somewhat knock kneed plus of course has the requisite howitzer grade bust ms st claire is being escorted to the impressive booth by two large men whose expressions are describable only as mug shottish this is another thing about porn starlets they re never alone they re always accompanied by at least one and sometimes as many as four flinty eyed males the impression is that of a very expensive thoroughbred being led onto the track under a silk blanket fyi ms jasmin st claire s cult celebrity status at the ces stems from her having broken the world gang bang record by taking on men in a row in amazing pictures world s biggest gang bang since most of these men were amateur porn fans who d had only to fill out an application and produce an hiv all clear from the dph she now enjoys an almost legendary populist appeal the people s porn star and an enormous serpentine line of fans with cameras and autographable memorabilia has formed at the impressive booth which line ms st claire appears for the moment to be ignoring because she and h hecuba having exchanged double cheek kisses are now deep into some kind of t te t te above the sockless docksiders of the unconscious bald kid who s the kid has evidently been carried or trundled by pranksters unknown from the xplor counter right next door to this one dick filth after your correspondents have remarked on how it s kind of heartwarming that everyone in the porn industry all seem to be friends even critics and performers dishes an involved anecdote about how jasmin st claire apparently once actually tried to strangle harold hecuba at an industry soir e a couple years ago an anecdote which if you re interested appears as fn just below twenty feet away over at xplor mr farrel timlake has meanwhile produced what is alleged to be the prototype and world s only authorized kenny action figure from the upcoming south park merchandising line fourteen inches tall kind of heavy for a doll w hood up and face obscured not unlike f timlake s own hood and face and is entertaining some of the im crowd s spillover by manipulating the doll s limbs to simulate its tok ing a bone not unlike urban gangs police carnival workers and certain other culturally marginalized guilds the us porn industry is occluded and insular in a way that makes it seem like high school there are cliques anticliques alliances betrayals conflagratory rumors legendary enmities and public bloodlettings plus involved hierarchies of popularity and influence you re either in or you re not performers being the industry s fissile core are of course in despite their financial power studio execs and producers are not very in and directors especially those who ve never undergone the initiation of having on camera sex themselves are less in than the performers film reviewers and industry journalists are even less in than execs and nonindustry journalists are way way non in almost as low caste as the great mass of porn fans themselves for which fans the insider term is mook the foregoing is meant to help explain how exactly your correspondents ended up in porn titan max hardcore s personal suite at the sahara and got to hang out in the suite s living room with max certain of his crew porn starlets alex dane and caressa savage and two b girls which is to say,"['describable', 'spend',

others as you would others should do unto you thus its first principle is love for the neighbor loving him as yourself when in society it would often be exceedingly difficult to decide how to treat those who are personally disagreeable to us if it were not for the rules of politeness and the little formalities and points of etiquette which these rules enforce these evidences of polite breeding do not prove hypocrisy as you may treat your most bitter enemy with perfect courtesy and yet make no protestations of friendship if politeness is but a mask as many philosophers tell us it is a mask which will win love and admiration and is better worn than cast aside if you wear it with the sincere desire to give pleasure to others and make all the little meetings of life pass off smoothly and agreeably it will soon cease to be a mask but you will find that the manner which you at first put on to give pleasure has become natural to you and wherever you have assumed a virtue to please others you will find the virtue becoming habitual and finally natural and part of yourself do not look upon the rules of etiquette as deceptions they are just as often vehicles for the expression of sincere feeling as they are the mask to conceal a want of it you will in society meet with men who rail against politeness and call it deceit and hypocrisy watch these men when they have an object to gain or are desirous of making a favorable impression and see them tacitly but unconsciously admit the power of courtesy by dropping for the time their uncouth ways to affect the politeness they oftentimes do not feel pass over the defects of others be prudent discreet at the proper time reserved yet at other times frank and treat others with the same gentle courtesy you would wish extended to yourself true politeness never embarrasses any one because its first object is to put all at their ease while it leaves to all perfect freedom of action you must meet rudeness from others by perfect politeness and polish of manner on your own part and you will thus shame those who have been uncivil to you you will more readily make them blush by your courtesy than if you met their rudeness by ill manners on your own part while a favor may be doubled in value by a frankly courteous manner of granting it a refusal will lose half its bitterness if your manner shows polite regret at your inability to oblige him who asks the favor at your hand politeness may be extended to the lowest and meanest and you will never by thus extending it detract from your own dignity a gentleman may and will treat his washerwoman with respect and courtesy and his boot black with pleasant affability yet preserve perfectly his own position to really merit the name of a polite finished gentleman you must be polite at all times and under all circumstances there is a difference between politeness and etiquette real politeness is in born and may exist in the savage while etiquette is the outward expression of politeness reduced to the rules current in good society a man may be polite really so in heart yet show in every movement an ignorance of the rules of etiquette and offend against the laws of society you may find him with his elbows upon the table or tilting his chair in a parlor you may see him commit every hour gross breaches of etiquette yet you will never hear him intentionally utter one word to wound another you will see that he habitually endeavors to make others comfortable choosing for them the easiest seats or the daintiest dishes and putting self entirely aside to contribute to the pleasure of all around him such a man will learn by contact with refined society that his ignorance of the rules which govern it make him at times disagreeable and from the same unselfish motive which prompts him to make a sacrifice of comfort for the sake of others he will watch and learn quickly almost by instinct where he offends against good breeding drop one by one his errors in etiquette and become truly a gentleman on the other hand you will meet constantly in the best society men whose polish of manner is exquisite who will perform to the minutest point the niceties of good breeding who never commit the least act that is forbidden by the strictest rules of etiquette yet under all this mask of chivalry gallantry and politeness will carry a cold selfish heart will with a sweet smile graceful bow and elegant language wound deeply the feelings of others and while passing in society for models of courtesy and elegance of manner be in feeling as cruel and barbarous as the veriest savage so i would say to you cultivate your heart cherish there the christian graces love for the neighbor unselfishness charity and gentleness and you will be truly a gentleman add to these the graceful forms of etiquette and you then become a perfect gentleman etiquette exists in every corner of the known world from the savages in the wilds of africa who dare not upon penalty of death approach their barbarous rulers without certain forms and ceremonies to the most refined circles of europe where gentle chivalry and a cultivated mind suggest its rules it has existed in all ages and the stringency of its laws in some countries has given rise to both ludicrous and tragic incidents in countries where royalty rules the etiquette it often happens that pride will blind those who make the rules and the results are often fatal believing that the same deference which their rank authorized them to demand was also due to them as individuals the result of such an idea was an etiquette as vain and useless as it was absurd for an example i will give an anecdote the kings of spain the proudest and vainest of all kings of the earth made a rule of etiquette as stupid as it was useless it was a fault punishable by death to touch the foot of the queen and the individual who thus offended no matter under what circumstances was executed immediately a young queen of spain wife of charles the second was riding on horseback in the midst of her attendants suddenly the horse reared and threw the queen from the saddle her foot remained in the stirrup and she was dragged along the ground an immense crowd stood looking at this spectacle but no one dared for his life to attempt to rescue the poor woman she would have died had not two young french officers ignorant of the stupid law which paralyzed the spaniards sprung forward and saved her one stopped the horse and whilst he held the bridle his companion disengaged from its painful position the foot of the young queen who was by this time insensible from fear and the bruises which she had already received they were instantly arrested and while the queen was carried on a litter to the palace her young champions were marched off accompanied by a strong guard to prison the next day sick and feeble the queen was obliged to leave her bed and on her knees before the king plead for the pardon of the two frenchmen and her prayer was only granted upon condition that the audacious foreigners left spain immediately there is no country in the world where the absurdities of etiquette are carried to so great a length as in spain because there is no nation where the nobility are so proud the following anecdote which illustrates this would seem incredible were it not a historical fact philip the third king of spain was sick and being able to sit up was carefully placed in an arm chair which stood opposite to a large fire when the wood was piled up to an enormous height the heat soon became intolerable and the courtiers retired from around the king but as the duke d ussede the fire stirrer for the king was not present and as no one else had the right to touch the fire those present dared not attempt to diminish the heat the grand chamberlain was also absent and he alone was authorized to touch the king s footstool the poor king too ill to rise in vain implored those around him to move his chair no one dared touch it and when the grand chamberlain arrived the king had fainted with the heat and a few days later he died literally roasted to death at almost all times and in almost all places good breeding may be shown and we think a good service will be done by pointing out a few plain and simple instances in which it stands opposed to habits and manners which though improper and disagreeable are not very uncommon in the familiar intercourse of society a well bred man will be known by the delicacy and deference with which he behaves towards females that man would deservedly be looked upon as very deficient in proper respect and feeling who should take any physical advantage of one of the weaker sex or offer any personal slight towards her woman looks and properly looks for protection to man it is the province of the husband to shield the wife from injury of the father to protect the daughter the brother has the same duty to perform towards the sister and in general every man should in this sense be the champion and the lover of every woman not only should he be ready to protect but desirous to please and willing to sacrifice much of his own personal ease and comfort if by doing so he can increase those of any female in whose company he may find himself putting these principles into practice a well bred man in his own house will be kind and respectful in his behaviour to every female of the family he will not use towards them harsh language even if called upon to express dissatisfaction with their conduct in conversation he will abstain from every allusion which would put modesty to the blush he will as much as in his power lighten their labors by cheerful and voluntary assistance he will yield to them every little advantage which may occur in the regular routine of domestic life the most comfortable seat if there be a difference the warmest position by the winter s fireside the nicest slice from the family joint and so on in a public assembly of any kind a well bred man will pay regard to the feelings and wishes of the females by whom he is surrounded he will not secure the best seat for himself and leave the women folk to take care of themselves he will not be seated at all if the meeting be crowded and a single female appear unaccommodated good breeding will keep a person from making loud and startling noises from pushing past another in entering or going out of a room from ostentatiously using a pocket handkerchief from hawking and spitting in company from fidgeting any part of the body from scratching the head or picking the teeth with fork or with finger in short it will direct all who study its rules to abstain from every personal act which may give pain or offence to another s feelings at the same time it will enable them to bear much without taking offence it will teach them when to speak and when to be silent and how to behave with due respect to all by attention to the rules of good breeding and more especially to its leading principles the poorest man will be entitled to the character of a gentleman and by inattention to them the most wealthy person will be essentially vulgar vulgarity signifies coarseness or indelicacy of manner and is not necessarily associated with poverty or lowliness of condition thus an operative artizan may be a gentleman and worthy of our particular esteem while an opulent merchant may be only a vulgar clown with whom it is impossible to be on terms of friendly intercourse the following remarks upon the character of a gentleman by brooke are so admirable that i need make no apology for quoting them entire he says there is no term in our language more common than that of gentleman and whenever it is heard all agree in the general idea of a man some way elevated above the vulgar yet perhaps no two living are precisely agreed respecting the qualities they think requisite for constituting this character when we hear the epithets of a fine gentleman a pretty gentleman much of a gentleman gentlemanlike something of a gentleman nothing of a gentleman and so forth all these different appellations must intend a peculiarity annexed to the ideas of those who express them though no two of them as i said may agree in the constituent qualities of the character they have formed in their own mind there have been ladies who deemed fashionable dress a very capital ingredient in the composition of a gentleman a certain easy impudence acquired by low people by casually being conversant in high life has passed a man current through many companies for a gentleman in taverns and brothels he who is the most of a bully is the most of a gentleman and the highwayman in his manner of taking your purse may however be allowed to have much of the gentleman plato among the philosophers was the most of a man of fashion and therefore allowed at the court of syracuse to be the most of a gentleman but seriously i apprehend that this character is pretty much upon the modern in all ancient or dead languages we have no term any way adequate whereby we may express it in the habits manners and characters of old sparta and old rome we find an antipathy to all the elements of modern gentility among these rude and unpolished people you read of philosophers of orators of patriots heroes and demigods but you never hear of any character so elegant as that of a pretty gentleman when those nations however became refined into what their ancestors would have called corruption when luxury introduced and fashion gave a sanction to certain sciences which cynics would have branded with the ill mannered appellations of drunkenness gambling cheating lying c the practitioners assumed the new title of gentlemen till such gentlemen became as plenteous as stars in the milky way and lost distinction merely by the confluence of their lustre wherefore as the said qualities were found to be of ready acquisition and of easy descent to the populace from their betters ambition judged it necessary to add further marks and criterions for severing the general herd from the nobler species of gentlemen accordingly if the commonalty were observed to have a propensity to religion their superiors affected a disdain of such vulgar prejudices and a freedom that cast off the restraints of morality and a courage that spurned at the fear of a god were accounted the distinguishing characteristics of a gentleman if the populace as in china were industrious and ingenious the grandees by the length of their nails and the cramping of their limbs gave evidence that true dignity was above labor and utility and that to be born to no end was the prerogative of a gentleman if the common sort by their conduct declared a respect for the institutions of civil society and good government their betters despised such pusillanimous conformity and the magistrates paid becoming regard to the distinction and allowed of the superior liberties and privileges of a gentleman if the lower set show a sense of common honesty and common order those who would figure in the world think it incumbent to demonstrate that complaisance to inferiors common manners common equity or any thing common is quite beneath the attention or sphere of a gentleman now as underlings are ever ambitious of imitating and usurping the manners of their superiors and as this state of mortality is incident to perpetual change and revolution it may happen that when the populace by encroaching on the province of gentility have arrived to their ne plus ultra of insolence irreligion c the gentry in order to be again distinguished may assume the station that their inferiors had forsaken and however ridiculous the supposition may appear at present humanity equity utility complaisance and piety may in time come to be the distinguishing characteristics of a gentleman it appears that the most general idea which people have formed of a gentleman is that of a person of fortune above the vulgar and embellished by manners that are fashionable in high life in this case fortune and fashion are the two constituent ingredients in the composition of modern gentlemen for whatever the fashion may be whether moral or immoral for or against reason right or wrong it is equally the duty of a gentleman to conform and yet i apprehend that true gentility is altogether independent of fortune or fashion of time customs or opinions of any kind the very same qualities that constituted a gentleman in the first age of the world are permanently invariably and indispensably necessary to the constitution of the same character to the end of time hector was the finest gentleman of whom we read in history and don quixote the finest gentleman we read of in romance as was instanced from the tenor of their principles and actions some time after the battle of cressy edward the third of england and edward the black prince the more than heir of his father s renown pressed john king of france to indulge them with the pleasure of his company at london john was desirous of embracing the invitation and accordingly laid the proposal before his parliament at paris the parliament objected that the invitation had been made with an insidious design of seizing his person thereby to make the cheaper and easier acquisition of the crown to which edward at that time pretended but john replied with some warmth that he was confident his brother edward and more especially his young cousin were too much of the gentleman to treat him in that manner he did not say too much of the king of the hero or of the saint but too much of the gentleman to be guilty of any baseness the sequel verified this opinion at the battle of poictiers king john was made prisoner and soon after conducted by the black prince to england the prince entered london in triumph amid the throng and acclamations of millions of the people but then this rather appeared to be the triumph of the french king than that of his conqueror john was seated on a proud steed royally robed and attended by a numerous and gorgeous train of the british nobility while his conqueror endeavored as much as possible to disappear and rode by his side in plain attire and degradingly seated on a little irish hobby as aristotle and the critics derived their rules for epic poetry and the sublime from a poem which homer had written long before the rules were formed or laws established for the purpose thus from the demeanor and innate principles of particular gentlemen art has borrowed and instituted the many modes of behaviour which the world has adopted under the title of good manners one quality of a gentleman is that of charity to the poor and this is delicately instanced in the account which don quixote gives to his fast friend sancho pancha of the valorous but yet more pious knight errant saint martin on a day said the don saint martin met a poor man half naked and taking his cloak from his shoulders he divided and gave him the one half now tell me at what time of the year this happened was i a witness quoth sancho how the vengeance should i know in what year or what time of the year it happened hadst thou sancho rejoined the knight anything within thee of the sentiment of saint martin thou must assuredly have known that this happened in winter for had it been summer saint martin would had given the whole cloak another characteristic of the true gentleman is a delicacy of behaviour toward that sex whom nature has entitled to the protection and consequently entitled to the tenderness of man the same gentleman errant entering into a wood on a summer s evening found himself entangled among nets of green thread that here and there hung from tree to tree and conceiving it some matter of purposed conjuration pushed valorously forward to break through the enchantment hereupon some beautiful shepherdesses interposed with a cry and besought him to spare the implements of their innocent recreation the knight surprised and charmed by the vision replied fair creatures my province is to protect not to injure to seek all means of service but never of offence more especially to any of your sex and apparent excellences your pretty nets take up but a small piece of favored ground but did they inclose the world i would seek out new worlds whereby i might win a passage rather than break them two very lovely but shamefaced girls had a cause of some consequence depending at westminster that indispensably required their personal appearance they were relations of sir joseph jeckel and on this tremendous occasion requested his company and countenance at the court sir joseph attended accordingly and the cause being opened the judge demanded whether he was to entitle those ladies by the denomination of spinsters no my lord said sir joseph they are lilies of the valley they toil not neither do they spin yet you see that no monarch in all his glory was ever arrayed like one of these another very peculiar characteristic of a gentleman is the giving place and yielding to all with whom he has to do of this we have a shining and affecting instance in abraham perhaps the most accomplished character that may be found in history whether sacred or profane a contention had arisen between the herdsmen of abraham and the herdsmen of his nephew lot respecting the propriety of the pasture of the lands wherein they dwelled that could now scarce contain the abundance of their cattle and those servants as is universally the case had respectively endeavored to kindle and inflame their masters with their own passions when abraham in consequence of this perceived that the countenance of lot began to change toward him he called and generously expostulated with him as followeth let there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee or between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen for we be brethren if it be thy desire to separate thyself from me is not the whole land before thee if thou wilt take the left hand then will i go to the right or if thou depart to the right hand then i will go to the left another capital quality of the true gentleman is that of feeling himself concerned and interested in others never was there so benevolent so affecting so pathetic a piece of oratory exhibited upon earth as that of abraham s pleading with god for averting the judgments that then impended over sodom but the matter is already so generally celebrated that i am constrained to refer my reader to the passage at full since the smallest abridgment must deduct from its beauties and that nothing can be added to the excellences thereof honor again is said in scripture peculiarly to distinguish the character of a gentleman where it is written of sechem the son of hamor that he was more honorable than all the house of his father from hence it may be inferred that human excellence or human amiableness doth not so much consist in a freedom from frailty as in our recovery from lapses our detestation of our own transgressions and our desire of atoning by all possible means the injuries we have done and the offences we have given herein therefore may consist the very singular distinction which the great apostle makes between his estimation of a just and of a good man for a just or righteous man says he one would grudge to die but for a good man one would even dare to die here the just man is supposed to adhere strictly to the rule of right or equity and to exact from others the same measure that he is satisfied to mete but the good man though occasionally he may fall short of justice has properly speaking no measure to his benevolence his general propensity is to give more than the due the just man condemns and is desirous of punishing the transgressors of the line prescribed to himself but the good man in the sense of his own falls and failings gives latitude indulgence and pardon to others he judges he condemns no one save himself the just man is a stream that deviates not to the right or left from its appointed channel neither is swelled by the flood of passion above its banks but the heart of the good man the man of honor the gentleman is as a lamp lighted by the breath of god and none save god himself can set limits to the efflux or irradiations thereof again the gentleman never envies any superior excellence but grows himself more excellent by being the admirer promoter and lover thereof saul said to his son jonathan thou son of the perverse rebellious woman do not i know that thou hast chosen the son of jesse to thine own confusion for as long as the son of jesse liveth upon the ground thou shalt not be established nor thy kingdom wherefore send and fetch him unto me for he shall surely die here every interesting motive that can possibly be conceived to have an influence on man united to urge jonathan to the destruction of david he would thereby have obeyed his king and pacified a father who was enraged against him he would thereby have removed the only luminary that then eclipsed the brightness of his own achievements and he saw as his father said that the death of david alone could establish the kingdom in himself and his posterity but all those considerations were of no avail to make jonathan swerve from honor to slacken the bands of his faith or cool the warmth of his friendship o jonathan the sacrifice which thou then madest to virtue was incomparably more illustrious in the sight of god and his angels than all the subsequent glories to which david attained what a crown was thine jonathan when thou wast slain in thy high places saul of tarsus had been a man of bigotry blood and violence making havoc and breathing out threatenings and slaughter against all who were not of his own sect and persuasion but when the spirit of that infant who laid himself in the manger of human flesh came upon him he acquired a new heart and a new nature and he offered himself a willing subject to all the sufferings and persecutions which he had brought upon others saul from that time exemplified in his own person all those qualities of the gentleman which he afterwards specifies in his celebrated description of that charity which as he says alone endureth forever when festus cried with a loud voice paul thou art beside thyself much learning doth make thee mad paul stretched the hand and answered i am not mad most noble festus but speak forth the words of truth and soberness for the king knoweth of these things before whom also i speak freely for i am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him king agrippa believest thou the prophets i know that thou believest then agrippa said unto paul almost thou persuadest me to be a christian and paul said i would to god that not only thou but also all that hear me this day were not only almost but altogether such as i am except these bonds here with what an inimitable elegance did this man in his own person at once sum up the orator the saint and the gentleman from these instances my friend you must have seen that the character or rather quality of a gentleman does not in any degree depend on fashion or mode on station or opinion neither changes with customs climate or ages but as the spirit of god can alone inspire it into man so it is as god is the same yesterday to day and forever in concluding this chapter i would say in the common actions and transactions of life there is a wide distinction between the well bred and the ill bred if a person of the latter sort be in a superior condition in life his conduct towards those below him or dependent upon him is marked by haughtiness or by unmannerly condescension in the company of his equals in station and circumstances an ill bred man is either captious and quarrelsome or offensively familiar he does not consider that the man who hails you tom or jack and proves by thumps upon your back how he esteems your merit is such a friend that one had need be very much a friend indeed to pardon or to bear it and if a man void of good breeding have to transact business with a superior in wealth or situation it is more than likely that he will be needlessly humble unintentionally insolent or at any rate miserably embarrassed on the contrary a well bred person will instinctively avoid all these errors to inferiors he will speak kindly and considerately so as to relieve them from any feeling of being beneath him in circumstances to equals he will be plain unaffected and courteous to superiors he will know how to show becoming respect without descending to subserviency or meanness in short he will act a manly inoffensive and agreeable part in all the situations in life in which he may be placed embed,"['favorable', 'forever', 'drop', 'inoffensive',

we fell early to work for the transportation of this great mass of gold near a mile by land to the beach and thence three miles by boat to the hispaniola was a considerable task for so small a number of workmen the three fellows still abroad upon the island did not greatly trouble us a single sentry on the shoulder of the hill was sufficient to ensure us against any sudden onslaught and we thought besides they had had more than enough of fighting therefore the work was pushed on briskly gray and ben gunn came and went with the boat while the rest during their absences piled treasure on the beach two of the bars slung in a rope s end made a good load for a grown man one that he was glad to walk slowly with for my part as i was not much use at carrying i was kept busy all day in the cave packing the minted money into bread bags it was a strange collection like billy bones s hoard for the diversity of coinage but so much larger and so much more varied that i think i never had more pleasure than in sorting them english french spanish portuguese georges and louises doubloons and double guineas and moidores and sequins the pictures of all the kings of europe for the last hundred years strange oriental pieces stamped with what looked like wisps of string or bits of spider s web round pieces and square pieces and pieces bored through the middle as if to wear them round your neck nearly every variety of money in the world must i think have found a place in that collection and for number i am sure they were like autumn leaves so that my back ached with stooping and my fingers with sorting them out day after day this work went on by every evening a fortune had been stowed aboard but there was another fortune waiting for the morrow and all this time we heard nothing of the three surviving mutineers at last i think it was on the third night the doctor and i were strolling on the shoulder of the hill where it overlooks the lowlands of the isle when from out the thick darkness below the wind brought us a noise between shrieking and singing it was only a snatch that reached our ears followed by the former silence heaven forgive them said the doctor tis the mutineers all drunk sir struck in the voice of silver from behind us silver i should say was allowed his entire liberty and in spite of daily rebuffs seemed to regard himself once more as quite a privileged and friendly dependent indeed it was remarkable how well he bore these slights and with what unwearying politeness he kept on trying to ingratiate himself with all yet i think none treated him better than a dog unless it was ben gunn who was still terribly afraid of his old quartermaster or myself who had really something to thank him for although for that matter i suppose i had reason to think even worse of him than anybody else for i had seen him meditating a fresh treachery upon the plateau accordingly it was pretty gruffly that the doctor answered him drunk or raving said he right you were sir replied silver and precious little odds which to you and me i suppose you would hardly ask me to call you a humane man returned the doctor with a sneer and so my feelings may surprise you master silver but if i were sure they were raving as i am morally certain one at least of them is down with fever i should leave this camp and at whatever risk to my own carcass take them the assistance of my skill ask your pardon sir you would be very wrong quoth silver you would lose your precious life and you may lay to that i m on your side now hand and glove and i shouldn t wish for to see the party weakened let alone yourself seeing as i know what i owes you but these men down there they couldn t keep their word no not supposing they wished to and what s more they couldn t believe as you could no said the doctor you re the man to keep your word we know that well that was about the last news we had of the three pirates only once we heard a gunshot a great way off and supposed them to be hunting a council was held and it was decided that we must desert them on the island to the huge glee i must say of ben gunn and with the strong approval of gray we left a good stock of powder and shot the bulk of the salt goat a few medicines and some other necessaries tools clothing a spare sail a fathom or two of rope and by the particular desire of the doctor a handsome present of tobacco that was about our last doing on the island before that we had got the treasure stowed and had shipped enough water and the remainder of the goat meat in case of any distress and at last one fine morning we weighed anchor which was about all that we could manage and stood out of north inlet the same colours flying that the captain had flown and fought under at the palisade the three fellows must have been watching us closer than we thought for as we soon had proved for coming through the narrows we had to lie very near the southern point and there we saw all three of them kneeling together on a spit of sand with their arms raised in supplication it went to all our hearts i think to leave them in that wretched state but we could not risk another mutiny and to take them home for the gibbet would have been a cruel sort of kindness the doctor hailed them and told them of the stores we had left and where they were to find them but they continued to call us by name and appeal to us for god s sake to be merciful and not leave them to die in such a place at last seeing the ship still bore on her course and was now swiftly drawing out of earshot one of them i know not which it was leapt to his feet with a hoarse cry whipped his musket to his shoulder and sent a shot whistling over silver s head and through the main sail after that we kept under cover of the bulwarks and when next i looked out they had disappeared from the spit and the spit itself had almost melted out of sight in the growing distance that was at least the end of that and before noon to my inexpressible joy the highest rock of treasure island had sunk into the blue round of sea we were so short of men that everyone on board had to bear a hand only the captain lying on a mattress in the stern and giving his orders for though greatly recovered he was still in want of quiet we laid her head for the nearest port in spanish america for we could not risk the voyage home without fresh hands and as it was what with baffling winds and a couple of fresh gales we were all worn out before we reached it it was just at sundown when we cast anchor in a most beautiful land locked gulf and were immediately surrounded by shore boats full of negroes and mexican indians and half bloods selling fruits and vegetables and offering to dive for bits of money the sight of so many good humoured faces especially the blacks the taste of the tropical fruits and above all the lights that began to shine in the town made a most charming contrast to our dark and bloody sojourn on the island and the doctor and the squire taking me along with them went ashore to pass the early part of the night here they met the captain of an english man of war fell in talk with him went on board his ship and in short had so agreeable a time that day was breaking when we came alongside the hispaniola ben gunn was on deck alone and as soon as we came on board he began with wonderful contortions to make us a confession silver was gone the maroon had connived at his escape in a shore boat some hours ago and he now assured us he had only done so to preserve our lives which would certainly have been forfeit if that man with the one leg had stayed aboard but this was not all the sea cook had not gone empty handed he had cut through a bulkhead unobserved and had removed one of the sacks of coin worth perhaps three or four hundred guineas to help him on his further wanderings i think we were all pleased to be so cheaply quit of him well to make a long story short we got a few hands on board made a good cruise home and the hispaniola reached bristol just as mr blandly was beginning to think of fitting out her consort five men only of those who had sailed returned with her drink and the devil had done for the rest with a vengeance although to be sure we were not quite in so bad a case as that other ship they sang about with one man of her crew alive what put to sea with seventy five all of us had an ample share of the treasure and used it wisely or foolishly according to our natures captain smollett is now retired from the sea gray not only saved his money but being suddenly smit with the desire to rise also studied his profession and he is now mate and part owner of a fine full rigged ship married besides and the father of a family as for ben gunn he got a thousand pounds which he spent or lost in three weeks or to be more exact in nineteen days for he was back begging on the twentieth then he was given a lodge to keep exactly as he had feared upon the island and he still lives a great favourite though something of a butt with the country boys and a notable singer in church on sundays and saints days of silver we have heard no more that formidable seafaring man with one leg has at last gone clean out of my life but i dare say he met his old negress and perhaps still lives in comfort with her and captain flint it is to be hoped so i suppose for his chances of comfort in another world are very small the bar silver and the arms still lie for all that i know where flint buried them and certainly they shall lie there for me oxen and wain ropes would not bring me back again to that accursed island and the worst dreams that ever i have are when i hear the surf booming about its coasts or start upright in bed with the sharp voice of captain flint still ringing in my

when he popped steel see mook rex and k shine think they the dipset them pussies make my dick wet i m just surprised charlie clips ain t make you his bitch yet while e ness raps that last bar the crowd reacts in shock and disgust to the bar just before it with more than a few people yelling pause cause mook ain t cam don t cut me off cause mook ain t cam e ness waits another eight seconds for the crowd to quiet down enough so he can start rapping again cause mook ain t cam and rex ain t jimmy and k shine can t be juelz cause his first name kenny don t wanna hear them songs bout them skinnies and you givin out shots if you can t take any now back to dna chill it s gon be ok cause when i m done with dna y all gon call him doa let s talk about dna he ll never win a vma he the type to swim with you from thirty five feet away let s break down dna s dna we all know he comes from a broken home one way mobile phone with the genetics of a retarded xy chromosome now y all came to see dna this dickhead in action or y all came to see me turn in the hulk and straight smash em cortez lame charlie has been them the two niggas supposed to be y all upper classmen hollow locked up so when i see him i m gon ask him are y all the black version of two and a half men see i know what you gon do you gon kick a few nameflips try to spit the same shit ya step pops charlie clips got in the game

m dancin with the devil and ya man wanna wrestle like these hands ain t successful and i m so special and i m so special cause i can get personal and disrespectful round dna e ness summer madness hm it almost feels like i signed up for a death wish cause this the first time i m the favorite and he s the underdog so y all gon cheer for anything he says cause y all don t expect shit but if i come with making the band cheesecake and p diddy jokes i might see the respect switch so i guess going bar for bar s the only option i m left with i was supposed to battle mook lux and serius but they ain t wanna accept this so url work hard to get me on the card and i knew when i made it leave the rest sick once i said i ll take the making the band nigga they said well we can get him for a flight hotel and less chips so since smack milked him for what he s worth then it s only right i get rid of ness quick nesquik now let s talk about your career in the industry cause it s sad but this is what i gotta do to hurt you cause you had your chance to make the deaf jam def jam but bad boy jocked you from going universal atlantic didn t want you interscope didn t need you so royalty checks you would never see none looks like them labels gave everybody else a deal but forgot to gave e one e that s cause ya image is horrible and all ya songs is trash and every verse you spit is plane so a rs get bored and pass boardin pass now what got me mad is you actually had a chance to be signed star so since bad boy ain t never let you shine shyne it s only right i make you suffer behind bars e ness

down the aisle and started dyin laughin i said you dumb for working there but clips said you the smart type cause your job ain t bullshit if you could pay your bills for pushing a cart right now i got a main problem with you ness it s how you want us battle rappers to be respectable when everybody on bad boy don t got respect for you if biggie was alive that nigga would probably snuff you if black rob seen you that nigga probably cut you lil kim wouldn t give you head faith evans wouldn t touch you come to think of it nigga even jae millz said fuck you so nigga fuck you cause every time i see your battle they fucking trash e ness fuck i hate your fucking face your fucking clothes and your fucking swag e ness fucking fuck your gang fuck your set fuck your flag e ness bullshit outta here

other bars to let you know you should fucking quit now that i disposed him who still believe that he king i just took away e heart e hart e ness say the cheesecake line again say the cheesecake line again now he can go battle at queen of the ring round e ness dna stands for the dirtiest nigga alive this is the cleanest you have ever been and i m somewhat surprised now someone tell dna to open up his eyes cause when you taking niggas money that s a whole different high now we d all like to thank charlie clips for taking care of dna i woulda been his father if his mother had the e j well charlie i m truly sorry it had to be this way my llama like a fucking piranha i let it eat away see ya music is trash your mixtapes never sell only way you ll get a deal is if you take one to tell i don t know why the fuck they gave me you i m crazier than crazy glue yeah i ve been skating through since i ve been doing this before the yankees wore navy blue fuck rap you get smacked crowd boos wow y all niggas booing man y all niggas hating listen i m not even gonna finish that let him rap nah nah they fucking my shit up smack tries to calm the crowd down i don t know why the fuck they gave me you i m crazier than crazy glue yeah i ve been skating through since i ve been doing this before the yankees wore navy blue and fuck rap you get smrrracked look at what you made me do and you getting lazy too i seen ya last battle if that tech ain t jam in that third round my man woulda had you i say that to say this niggas like you i can t bang with why cause you only as tough as them niggas you hang with and y all gon hate when i say this when i say mook ain t the greatest cause mook ain t been talked about since math gave him a facelift word is math hoffa ain t no gat popper crowd boos i guess you held ya own but then you really did some faggot shit to kill see rone for rone bar for bar woulda beat you probably but what type of nigga you know tape a fake bomb to his body he ripped off his hoodie no t shirt no tanktop your whole career s been built off the glass you re a bankshop now let me tell you some more faggot shit when you battle big titus i mma expose this litte nigga for the people that didn t see it some super duper gay shit man i just couldn t believe it cause the first half of that second round was talking about that man penis now i mma tell you some more shit i found out about this nigga when i was coming up the highway this bum ass nigga tried to take charli baltimore out on a date to tgi friday now you need to beg one of the labels to give you some money and stop trying to treat these hoes to a for this faggot just cut his dick off and sit next rick ross wear a bunch of lip gloss go and get his shit tossed this fight was fixed don t you feel like you ripped off scrolling through them call logs looking through them miss calls ask ya man should you battle ness he told you nig nah i fuck with you and everything but i m not going with y all fucking with him you done ran into a brick wall pitfall chris paul when he get his shit off these diamonds are forever say something clever cause nobody what you say i m gon translate it better and that bullshit move you threw on youtube was the dumbest shit i seen in my life to get views now go ahead let him have it let him have it round dna e ness round one and two i already show y all who s the better rapper but this the part where we analyze your career like a book and go through every chapter see i done mentioned cheesecake making the band and p diddy cause y all would say it s predictable and call it wack but ask yourself this what else has e ness done to put his career on the map so instead of saying i m being predictable tell this man he hasn t progressed i bet you never thought of that cause if in ten years you only known for three things now whose fault is this see this battle rap world started off as a network and over time it became community so to see someone make it we should all be happy and spread the unity but i m angry at what you could ve been and for that you a fool to me cause every battle rapper wouldve died for that opportunity so as a man as a father as a artist you are useless you don t blog do videos or put out any music so how could you get mad if we mention cheese cake making a band p diddy or you getting fucking shelved when you had several opportunities in your career to do something else that s why the stuff i m telling you right now is some of the realest shit there s a hundred dudes that should be in your spot cause they was really out killing shit iron solomon and mysonne joked about that cheese cake nigga i m dead serious they started something but with this scheme right here i mma finish it i ll bet everybody you know gave you a pound when you made it on that show cause they thought you was all great little did they know you were cause after biggie died diddy had lost faith thought ya music was bananas but you realized it wasn t by your fourth tape so he shelved you on your birthday and you went into depression and started pitching that raw base but have to provide for your kids so you traded in them karats started gaining more weight do anything to make sure they get food all month and make sure they all safe now y all don t need a pineapple to see his life s upside down and in the wrong place so going to juniors made sense cause in the end all diddy ever gave you was short cake now i want no applause for that so don t start shaking my hand that was just chapter one chapter two is making the band when diddy first started fucking with you he liked for your aggressiveness and your passion so much to the point that out of everyone on that show he made you the captain thought you would have a bright future thought would move in the world far so how the fuck did you let chopper become more popular than you on world star e ness fuck outta here you don t do no shows don t put out no mixtapes you ain t seeing bling and babs is more popular than you in battle rap off of hosting queen of the ring now mysonne and iron solomon joked about the band but nigga i m dead serious they started something but with this scheme right here i mma finish it you see your career is like the internet it started off at a high speed and you became the man quick but made a lot of bad connections so all of puff s plans switched lost every industry friend nobody to dial up and all of ya fans dipped and now got the lowest buzz online out of anyone you was in that band with bandwidth but i don t want no cheers for that so don t start making mad noise cause that was chapter two chapter three is bad boy now clearly puff don t fuck with you or you don t know math boy cause that chain you got says b that lets me know you don t know how to add boy e ness it s a l nigga loch ness loch ness get it b add boy that equals bad boy for the fact your chain doesn t say that that lets me know you doing bad boy did i speed it up too fast am i going too fast boy looks like puff and no one on that label fuck with you on bad boy you should palm smacked til you fall cause out of everybody you got the worse contract of them all if they woulda gave that to black rob he woulda say whoa whoa whoa whoa g dep woulda asked for a special delivery and been gone mase woulda hopped on his horse and carriage as soon as that bread s gone would say it s over now faith evans was too head strong biggie looked you dead in the eye and told you you dead wrong now in conclusion to my third round as y all see i killed him e ness is deceased now finally this young man can start resting in peace it s round three it s getting hot in here and off the career choices you made you got yourself the fuck outta here embed,"['rex',

it is dudley there it is check it out verse this beat slapping like goldie at the player s ball coming out his robe if his paper small to show my ass and shit on you is not a nature call i m tryna crack your head and blow your mind til you paint your wall the rappers that i ate that you consider great were all cold but then they froze and afterwards i watched a glacier fall through hellfire hotter than a taco bell fryer in a building next to belle tire i exc l higher than a propel flyer aft r lighting up an l prior to catching the holy ghost by a hired female choir and that s just me messing around i m the pie in the sky the treasure chest in the ground oil struck on the planet what else you thought ran it the whole battlefield becomes abandoned once i drop a war missile you feeling like a pimp go on and brush your shoulders off but you can get swept as soon as i mop the floor with you don t wind up in a strange land with a deranged man those with short change can t keep they two cents before it exchange hands cause that s a nuisance bout as much as someone i knew since i started using my brain when they ain t gain any new sense and won t even give focus with a few squints looking through tints another dead man here and was found as the head bandit without a headband slid so instead where he bled landed all on my blueprints that s how i caught him red handed so who s a fool impressing with they medulla guessing school s in session i m the open book you study for the rule and lesson you might also like chorus yeah there it is i m not the one to test no need to prepare a quiz too many claim king but can t sit in this chair of his all that talk ll have you laid out in front of your therapist yeah ayy there it is verse look i ll destroy your fam like dysfunctional marriages that won t even spare the kids inside of the carriages rap is like the crack game peep pac compare to biz yeah if i put my hands on you it s to heal but the thought alone would kill y all your threats still fall under wolf tickets i d only buy to see tyler the creator while y all selling them at will call have several seats before the real stall i ll show you the bigger picture as if i were a theater mission failed if you think you dissing el from up under his nose when suspicion smell like rats with a missing tail that kiss and tell and list entail through dark nights like christian bale i can tell you how a mossberg sounds before battle rap i watched niggas flip quarters then i heard rounds i got the juice like q when bishop grip came a loose on the tall building then the fall killed him is that confusing as teaching small children to rep a nation that give reparations but hate foreigners when they all pilgrims it s the way i create formulas that bubble in the beakers to flow through the speakers and knock you out your sneakers you wouldn t stand a chance rich rappers put up your hundred grand advance with the pen i can turn a name into a number shackle you and have you escorted through the right entrance to be put in a mental prison so why would i sweat your bars knowing they coming with a light sentence you a block away and i m a flight distance i m just living out predictions from a palm reader who light incense whether old nigga new nigga don t become a memory to make some beer pour out of brew swigger i would rather be here for you that s word to georgia anne and declaime we came to record the standout album of the year for the listeners to those cooking up a diss like it s a dish for us it s gon get ate up how it s

things comes on mr tartar s chambers were the neatest the cleanest and the best ordered chambers ever seen under the sun moon and stars the floors were scrubbed to that extent that you might have supposed the london blacks emancipated for ever and gone out of the land for good every inch of brass work in mr tartar s possession was polished and burnished till it shone like a brazen mirror no speck nor spot nor spatter soiled the purity of any of mr tartar s household gods large small or middle sized his sitting room was like the admiral s cabin his bath room was like a dairy his sleeping chamber fitted all about with lockers and drawers was like a seedsman s shop and his nicely balanced cot just stirred in the midst as if it breathed everything belonging to mr tartar had quarters of its own assigned to it his maps and charts had their quarters his books had theirs his brushes had theirs his boots had theirs his clothes had theirs his case bottles had theirs his telescopes and other instruments had theirs everything was readily accessible shelf bracket locker hook and drawer were equally within reach and were equally contrived with a view to avoiding waste of room and providing some snug inches of stowage for something that would have exactly fitted nowhere else his gleaming little service of plate was so arranged upon his sideboard as that a slack salt spoon would have instantly betrayed itself his toilet implements were so arranged upon his dressing table as that a toothpick of slovenly deportment could have been reported at a glance so with the curiosities he had brought home from various voyages stuffed dried repolished or otherwise preserved according to their kind birds fishes reptiles arms articles of dress shells seaweeds grasses or memorials of coral reef each was displayed in its especial place and each could have been displayed in no better place paint and varnish seemed to be kept somewhere out of sight in constant readiness to obliterate stray finger marks wherever any might become perceptible in mr tartar s chambers no man of war was ever kept more spick and span from careless touch on this bright summer day a neat awning was rigged over mr tartar s flower garden as only a sailor can rig it and there was a sea going air upon the whole effect so delightfully complete that the flower garden might have appertained to stern windows afloat and the whole concern might have bowled away gallantly with all on board if mr tartar had only clapped to his lips the speaking trumpet that was slung in a corner and given hoarse orders to heave the anchor up look alive there men and get all sail upon her mr tartar doing the honours of this gallant craft was of a piece with the rest when a man rides an amiable hobby that shies at nothing and kicks nobody it is only agreeable to find him riding it with a humorous sense of the droll side of the creature when the man is a cordial and an earnest man by nature and withal is perfectly fresh and genuine it may be doubted whether he is ever seen to greater advantage than at such a time so rosa would have naturally thought even if she hadn t been conducted over the ship with all the homage due to the first lady of the admiralty or first fairy of the sea that it was charming to see and hear mr tartar half laughing at and half rejoicing in his various contrivances so rosa would have naturally thought anyhow that the sunburnt sailor showed to great advantage when the inspection finished he delicately withdrew out of his admiral s cabin beseeching her to consider herself its queen and waving her free of his flower garden with the hand that had had mr crisparkle s life in it helena helena landless are you there who speaks to me not rosa then a second handsome face appearing yes my darling why how did you come here dearest i i don t quite know said rosa with a blush unless i am dreaming why with a blush for their two faces were alone with the other flowers are blushes among the fruits of the country of the magic bean stalk i am not dreaming said helena smiling i should take more for granted if i were how do we come together or so near together so very unexpectedly unexpectedly indeed among the dingy gables and chimney pots of p j t s connection and the flowers that had sprung from the salt sea but rosa waking told in a hurry how they came to be together and all the why and wherefore of that matter and mr crisparkle is here said rosa in rapid conclusion and could you believe it long ago he saved his life i could believe any such thing of mr crisparkle returned helena with a mantling face more blushes in the bean stalk country yes but it wasn t crisparkle said rosa quickly putting in the correction i don t understand love it was very nice of mr crisparkle to be saved said rosa and he couldn t have shown his high opinion of mr tartar more expressively but it was mr tartar who saved him helena s dark eyes looked very earnestly at the bright face among the leaves and she asked in a slower and more thoughtful tone is mr tartar with you now dear no because he has given up his rooms to me to us i mean it is such a beautiful place is it it is like the inside of the most exquisite ship that ever sailed it is like it is like like a dream suggested helena rosa answered with a little nod and smelled the flowers helena resumed after a short pause of silence during which she seemed or it was rosa s fancy to compassionate somebody my poor neville is reading in his own room the sun being so very bright on this side just now i think he had better not know that you are so near o i think so too cried rosa very readily i suppose pursued helena doubtfully that he must know by and by all you have told me but i am not sure ask mr crisparkle s advice my darling ask him whether i may tell neville as much or as little of what you have told me as i think best rosa subsided into her state cabin and propounded the question the minor canon was for the free exercise of helena s judgment i thank him very much said helena when rosa emerged again with her report ask him whether it would be best to wait until any more maligning and pursuing of neville on the part of this wretch shall disclose itself or to try to anticipate it i mean so far as to find out whether any such goes on darkly about us the minor canon found this point so difficult to give a confident opinion on that after two or three attempts and failures he suggested a reference to mr grewgious helena acquiescing he betook himself with a most unsuccessful assumption of lounging indifference across the quadrangle to p j t s and stated it mr grewgious held decidedly to the general principle that if you could steal a march upon a brigand or a wild beast you had better do it and he also held decidedly to the special case that john jasper was a brigand and a wild beast in combination thus advised mr crisparkle came back again and reported to rosa who in her turn reported to helena she now steadily pursuing her train of thought at her window considered thereupon we may count on mr tartar s readiness to help us rosa she inquired o yes rosa shyly thought so o yes rosa shyly believed she could almost answer for it but should she ask mr crisparkle i think your authority on the point as good as his my dear said helena sedately and you needn t disappear again for that odd of helena you see neville helena pursued after more reflection knows no one else here he has not so much as exchanged a word with any one else here if mr tartar would call to see him openly and often if he would spare a minute for the purpose frequently if he would even do so almost daily something might come of it something might come of it dear repeated rosa surveying her friend s beauty with a highly perplexed face something might if neville s movements are really watched and if the purpose really is to isolate him from all friends and acquaintance and wear his daily life out grain by grain which would seem to be the threat to you does it not appear likely said helena that his enemy would in some way communicate with mr tartar to warn him off from neville in which case we might not only know the fact but might know from mr tartar what the terms of the communication were i see cried rosa and immediately darted into her state cabin again presently her pretty face reappeared with a greatly heightened colour and she said that she had told mr crisparkle and that mr crisparkle had fetched in mr tartar and that mr tartar who is waiting now in case you want him added rosa with a half look back and in not a little confusion between the inside of the state cabin and out had declared his readiness to act as she had suggested and to enter on his task that very day i thank him from my heart said helena pray tell him so again not a little confused between the flower garden and the cabin rosa dipped in with her message and dipped out again with more assurances from mr tartar and stood wavering in a divided state between helena and him which proved that confusion is not always necessarily awkward but may sometimes present a very pleasant appearance and now darling said helena we will be mindful of the caution that has restricted us to this interview for the present and will part i hear neville moving too are you going back to miss twinkleton s asked rosa yes o i could never go there any more i couldn t indeed after that dreadful interview said rosa then where are you going pretty one now i come to think of it i don t know said rosa i have settled nothing at all yet but my guardian will take care of me don t be uneasy dear i shall be sure to be somewhere it did seem likely and i shall hear of my rosebud from mr tartar inquired helena yes i suppose so from rosa looked back again in a flutter instead of supplying the name but tell me one thing before we part dearest helena tell me that you are sure sure sure i couldn t help it help it love help making him malicious and revengeful i couldn t hold any terms with him could i you know how i love you darling answered helena with indignation but i would sooner see you dead at his wicked feet that s a great comfort to me and you will tell your poor brother so won t you and you will give him my remembrance and my sympathy and you will ask him not to hate me with a mournful shake of the head as if that would be quite a superfluous entreaty helena lovingly kissed her two hands to her friend and her friend s two hands were kissed to her and then she saw a third hand a brown one appear among the flowers and leaves and help her friend out of sight the refection that mr tartar produced in the admiral s cabin by merely touching the spring knob of a locker and the handle of a drawer was a dazzling enchanted repast wonderful macaroons glittering liqueurs magically preserved tropical spices and jellies of celestial tropical fruits displayed themselves profusely at an instant s notice but mr tartar could not make time stand still and time with his hard hearted fleetness strode on so fast that rosa was obliged to come down from the bean stalk country to earth and her guardian s chambers and now my dear said mr grewgious what is to be done next to put the same thought in another form what is to be done with you rosa could only look apologetically sensible of being very much in her own way and in everybody else s some passing idea of living fireproof up a good many stairs in furnival s inn for the rest of her life was the only thing in the nature of a plan that occurred to her it has come into my thoughts said mr grewgious that as the respected lady miss twinkleton occasionally repairs to london in the recess with the view of extending her connection and being available for interviews with metropolitan parents if any whether until we have time in which to turn ourselves round we might invite miss twinkleton to come and stay with you for a month stay where sir whether explained mr grewgious we might take a furnished lodging in town for a month and invite miss twinkleton to assume the charge of you in it for that period and afterwards hinted rosa and afterwards said mr grewgious we should be no worse off than we are now i think that might smooth the way assented rosa then let us said mr grewgious rising go and look for a furnished lodging nothing could be more acceptable to me than the sweet presence of last evening for all the remaining evenings of my existence but these are not fit surroundings for a young lady let us set out in quest of adventures and look for a furnished lodging in the meantime mr crisparkle here about to return home immediately will no doubt kindly see miss twinkleton and invite that lady to co operate in our plan mr crisparkle willingly accepting the commission took his departure mr grewgious and his ward set forth on their expedition as mr grewgious s idea of looking at a furnished lodging was to get on the opposite side of the street to a house with a suitable bill in the window and stare at it and then work his way tortuously to the back of the house and stare at that and then not go in but make similar trials of another house with the same result their progress was but slow at length he bethought himself of a widowed cousin divers times removed of mr bazzard s who had once solicited his influence in the lodger world and who lived in southampton street bloomsbury square this lady s name stated in uncompromising capitals of considerable size on a brass door plate and yet not lucidly as to sex or condition was billickin personal faintness and an overpowering personal candour were the distinguishing features of mrs billickin s organisation she came languishing out of her own exclusive back parlour with the air of having been expressly brought to for the purpose from an accumulation of several swoons i hope i see you well sir said mrs billickin recognising her visitor with a bend thank you quite well and you ma am returned mr grewgious i am as well said mrs billickin becoming aspirational with excess of faintness as i hever ham my ward and an elderly lady said mr grewgious wish to find a genteel lodging for a month or so have you any apartments available ma am mr grewgious returned mrs billickin i will not deceive you far from it i have apartments available this with the air of adding convey me to the stake if you will but while i live i will be candid and now what apartments ma am asked mr grewgious cosily to tame a certain severity apparent on the part of mrs billickin there is this sitting room which call it what you will it is the front parlour miss said mrs billickin impressing rosa into the conversation the back parlour being what i cling to and never part with and there is two bedrooms at the top of the ouse with gas laid on i do not tell you that your bedroom floors is firm for firm they are not the gas fitter himself allowed that to make a firm job he must go right under your jistes and it were not worth the outlay as a yearly tenant so to do the piping is carried above your jistes and it is best that it should be made known to you mr grewgious and rosa exchanged looks of some dismay though they had not the least idea what latent horrors this carriage of the piping might involve mrs billickin put her hand to her heart as having eased it of a load well the roof is all right no doubt said mr grewgious plucking up a little mr grewgious returned mrs billickin if i was to tell you sir that to have nothink above you is to have a floor above you i should put a deception upon you which i will not do no sir your slates will rattle loose at that elewation in windy weather do your utmost best or worst i defy you sir be you what you may to keep your slates tight try how you can here mrs billickin having been warm with mr grewgious cooled a little not to abuse the moral power she held over him consequent proceeded mrs billickin more mildly but still firmly in her incorruptible candour consequent it would be worse than of no use for me to trapse and travel up to the top of the ouse with you and for you to say mrs billickin what stain do i notice in the ceiling for a stain i do consider it and for me to answer i do not understand you sir no sir i will not be so underhand i do understand you before you pint it out it is the wet sir it do come in and it do not come in you may lay dry there half your lifetime but the time will come and it is best that you should know it when a dripping sop would be no name for you mr grewgious looked much disgraced by being prefigured in this pickle have you any other apartments ma am he asked mr grewgious returned mrs billickin with much solemnity i have you ask me have i and my open and my honest answer air i have the first and second floors is wacant and sweet rooms come come there s nothing against them said mr grewgious comforting himself mr grewgious replied mrs billickin pardon me there is the stairs unless your mind is prepared for the stairs it will lead to inevitable disappointment you cannot miss said mrs billickin addressing rosa reproachfully place a first floor and far less a second on the level footing of a parlour no you cannot do it miss it is beyond your power and wherefore try mrs billickin put it very feelingly as if rosa had shown a headstrong determination to hold the untenable position can we see these rooms ma am inquired her guardian mr grewgious returned mrs billickin you can i will not disguise it from you sir you can mrs billickin then sent into her back parlour for her shawl it being a state fiction dating from immemorial antiquity that she could never go anywhere without being wrapped up and having been enrolled by her attendant led the way she made various genteel pauses on the stairs for breath and clutched at her heart in the drawing room as if it had very nearly got loose and she had caught it in the act of taking wing and the second floor said mr grewgious on finding the first satisfactory mr grewgious replied mrs billickin turning upon him with ceremony as if the time had now come when a distinct understanding on a difficult point must be arrived at and a solemn confidence established the second floor is over this can we see that too ma am yes sir returned mrs billickin it is open as the day that also proving satisfactory mr grewgious retired into a window with rosa for a few words of consultation and then asking for pen and ink sketched out a line or two of agreement in the meantime mrs billickin took a seat and delivered a kind of index to or abstract of the general question five and forty shillings per week by the month certain at the time of year said mrs billickin is only reasonable to both parties it is not bond street nor yet st james s palace but it is not pretended that it is neither is it attempted to be denied for why should it that the arching leads to a mews mewses must exist respecting attendance two is kep at liberal wages words has arisen as to tradesmen but dirty shoes on fresh hearth stoning was attributable and no wish for a commission on your orders coals is either by the fire or per the scuttle she emphasised the prepositions as marking a subtle but immense difference dogs is not viewed with favour besides litter they gets stole and sharing suspicions is apt to creep in and unpleasantness takes place by this time mr grewgious had his agreement lines and his earnest money ready i have signed it for the ladies ma am he said and you ll have the goodness to sign it for yourself christian and surname there if you please mr grewgious said mrs billickin in a new burst of candour no sir you must excuse the christian name mr grewgious stared at her the door plate is used as a protection said mrs billickin and acts as such and go from it i will not mr grewgious stared at rosa no mr grewgious you must excuse me so long as this ouse is known indefinite as billickin s and so long as it is a doubt with the riff raff where billickin may be hidin near the street door or down the airy and what his weight and size so long i feel safe but commit myself to a solitary female statement no miss nor would you for a moment wish said mrs billickin with a strong sense of injury to take that advantage of your sex if you were not brought to it by inconsiderate example rosa reddening as if she had made some most disgraceful attempt to overreach the good lady besought mr grewgious to rest content with any signature and accordingly in a baronial way the sign manual billickin got appended to the document details were then settled for taking possession on the next day but one when miss twinkleton might be reasonably expected and rosa went back to furnival s inn on her guardian s arm behold mr tartar walking up and down furnival s inn checking himself when he saw them coming and advancing towards them it occurred to me hinted mr tartar that we might go up the river the weather being so delicious and the tide serving i have a boat of my own at the temple stairs i have not been up the river for this many a day said mr grewgious tempted i was never up the river added rosa within half an hour they were setting this matter right by going up the river the tide was running with them the afternoon was charming mr tartar s boat was perfect mr tartar and lobley mr tartar s man pulled a pair of oars mr tartar had a yacht it seemed lying somewhere down by greenhithe and mr tartar s man had charge of this yacht and was detached upon his present service he was a jolly favoured man with tawny hair and whiskers and a big red face he was the dead image of the sun in old woodcuts his hair and whiskers answering for rays all around him resplendent in the bow of the boat he was a shining sight with a man of war s man s shirt on or off according to opinion and his arms and breast tattooed all sorts of patterns lobley seemed to take it easily and so did mr tartar yet their oars bent as they pulled and the boat bounded under them mr tartar talked as if he were doing nothing to rosa who was really doing nothing and to mr grewgious who was doing this much that he steered all wrong but what did that matter when a turn of mr tartar s skilful wrist or a mere grin of mr lobley s over the bow put all to rights the tide bore them on in the gayest and most sparkling manner until they stopped to dine in some ever lastingly green garden needing no matter of fact identification here and then the tide obligingly turned being devoted to that party alone for that day and as they floated idly among some osier beds rosa tried what she could do in the rowing way and came off splendidly being much assisted and mr grewgious tried what he could do and came off on his back doubled up with an oar under his chin being not assisted at all then there was an interval of rest under boughs such rest what time mr lobley mopped and arranging cushions stretchers and the like danced the tight rope the whole length of the boat like a man to whom shoes were a superstition and stockings slavery and then came the sweet return among delicious odours of limes in bloom and musical ripplings and all too soon the great black city cast its shadow on the waters and its dark bridges spanned them as death spans life and the everlastingly green garden seemed to be left for everlasting unregainable and far away cannot people get through life without gritty stages i wonder rosa thought next day when the town was very gritty again and everything had a strange and an uncomfortable appearance of seeming to wait for something that wouldn t come no she began to think that now the cloisterham school days had glided past and gone the gritty stages would begin to set in at intervals and make themselves wearily known yet what did rosa expect did she expect miss twinkleton miss twinkleton duly came forth from her back parlour issued the billickin to receive miss twinkleton and war was in the billickin s eye from that fell moment miss twinkleton brought a quantity of luggage with her having all rosa s as well as her own the billickin took it ill that miss twinkleton s mind being sorely disturbed by this luggage failed to take in her personal identity with that clearness of perception which was due to its demands stateliness mounted her gloomy throne upon the billickin s brow in consequence and when miss twinkleton in agitation taking stock of her trunks and packages of which she had seventeen particularly counted in the billickin herself as number eleven the b found it necessary to repudiate things cannot too soon be put upon the footing said she with a candour so demonstrative as to be almost obtrusive that the person of the ouse is not a box nor yet a bundle nor a carpet bag no i am ily obleeged to you miss twinkleton nor yet a beggar this last disclaimer had reference to miss twinkleton s distractedly pressing two and sixpence on her instead of the cabman thus cast off miss twinkleton wildly inquired which gentleman was to be paid there being two gentlemen in that position miss twinkleton having arrived with two cabs each gentleman on being paid held forth his two and sixpence on the flat of his open hand and with a speechless stare and a dropped jaw displayed his wrong to heaven and earth terrified by this alarming spectacle miss twinkleton placed another shilling in each hand at the same time appealing to the law in flurried accents and recounting her luggage this time with the two gentlemen in who caused the total to come out complicated meanwhile the two gentlemen each looking very hard at the last shilling grumblingly as if it might become eighteen pence if he kept his eyes on it descended the doorsteps ascended their carriages and drove away leaving miss twinkleton on a bonnet box in tears the billickin beheld this manifestation of weakness without sympathy and gave directions for a young man to be got in to wrestle with the luggage when that gladiator had disappeared from the arena peace ensued and the new lodgers dined but the billickin had somehow come to the knowledge that miss twinkleton kept a school the leap from that knowledge to the inference that miss twinkleton set herself to teach her something was easy but you don t do it soliloquised the billickin i am not your pupil whatever she meaning rosa may be poor thing miss twinkleton on the other hand having changed her dress and recovered her spirits was animated by a bland desire to improve the occasion in all ways and to be as serene a model as possible in a happy compromise between her two states of existence she had already become with her workbasket before her the equably vivacious companion with a slight judicious flavouring of information when the billickin announced herself i will not hide from you ladies said the b enveloped in the shawl of state for it is not my character to hide neither my motives nor my actions that i take the liberty to look in upon you to express a ope that your dinner was to your liking though not professed but plain still her wages should be a sufficient object to her to stimilate to soar above mere roast and biled we dined very well indeed said rosa thank you accustomed said miss twinkleton with a gracious air which to the jealous ears of the billickin seemed to add my good woman accustomed to a liberal and nutritious yet plain and salutary diet we have found no reason to bemoan our absence from the ancient city and the methodical household in which the quiet routine of our lot has been hitherto cast i did think it well to mention to my cook observed the billickin with a gush of candour which i ope you will agree with miss twinkleton was a right precaution that the young lady being used to what we should consider here but poor diet had better be brought forward by degrees for a rush from scanty feeding to generous feeding and from what you may call messing to what you may call method do require a power of constitution which is not often found in youth particular when undermined by boarding school it will be seen that the billickin now openly pitted herself against miss twinkleton as one whom she had fully ascertained to be her natural enemy your remarks returned miss twinkleton from a remote moral eminence are well meant i have no doubt but you will permit me to observe that they develop a mistaken view of the subject which can only be imputed to your extreme want of accurate information my informiation retorted the billickin throwing in an extra syllable for the sake of emphasis at once polite and powerful my informiation miss twinkleton were my own experience which i believe is usually considered to be good guidance but whether so or not i was put in youth to a very genteel boarding school the mistress being no less a lady than yourself of about your own age or it may be some years younger and a poorness of blood flowed from the table which has run through my life very likely said miss twinkleton still from her distant eminence and very much to be deplored rosa my dear how are you getting on with your work miss twinkleton resumed the billickin in a courtly manner before retiring on the int as a lady should i wish to ask of yourself as a lady whether i am to consider that my words is doubted i am not aware on what ground you cherish such a supposition began miss twinkleton when the billickin neatly stopped her do not if you please put suppositions betwixt my lips where none such have been imparted by myself your flow of words is great miss twinkleton and no doubt is expected from you by your pupils and no doubt is considered worth the money no doubt i am sure but not paying for flows of words and not asking to be favoured with them here i wish to repeat my question if you refer to the poverty of your circulation began miss twinkleton when again the billickin neatly stopped her i have used no such expressions if you refer then to the poorness of your blood brought upon me stipulated the billickin expressly at a boarding school then resumed miss twinkleton all i can say is that i am bound to believe on your asseveration that it is very poor indeed i cannot forbear adding that if that unfortunate circumstance influences your conversation it is much to be lamented and it is eminently desirable that your blood were richer rosa my dear how are you getting on with your work hem before retiring miss proclaimed the billickin to rosa loftily cancelling miss twinkleton i should wish it to be understood between yourself and me that my transactions in future is with you alone i know no elderly lady here miss none older than yourself a highly desirable arrangement rosa my dear observed miss twinkleton it is not miss said the billickin with a sarcastic smile that i possess the mill i have heard of in which old single ladies could be ground up young what a gift it would be to some of us but that i limit myself to you totally when i have any desire to communicate a request to the person of the house rosa my dear observed miss twinkleton with majestic cheerfulness i will make it known to you and you will kindly undertake i am sure that it is conveyed to the proper quarter good evening miss said the billickin at once affectionately and distantly being alone in my eyes i wish you good evening with best wishes and do not find myself drove i am truly appy to say into expressing my contempt for an indiwidual unfortunately for yourself belonging to you the billickin gracefully withdrew with this parting speech and from that time rosa occupied the restless position of shuttlecock between these two battledores nothing could be done without a smart match being played out thus on the daily arising question of dinner miss twinkleton would say the three being present together perhaps my love you will consult with the person of the house whether she can procure us a lamb s fry or failing that a roast fowl on which the billickin would retort rosa not having spoken a word if you was better accustomed to butcher s meat miss you would not entertain the idea of a lamb s fry firstly because lambs has long been sheep and secondly because there is such things as killing days and there is not as to roast fowls miss why you must be quite surfeited with roast fowls letting alone your buying when you market for yourself the agedest of poultry with the scaliest of legs quite as if you was accustomed to picking em out for cheapness try a little inwention miss use yourself to ousekeeping a bit come now think of somethink else to this encouragement offered with the indulgent toleration of a wise and liberal expert miss twinkleton would rejoin reddening or my dear you might propose to the person of the house a duck well miss the billickin would exclaim still no word being spoken by rosa you do surprise,"['threat', 'flow', 'uneasy', 'dog', 'earnest',

contributorsuniversity of california regents v bakke lyrics u s regents of the university of california v bakke no supreme court of united states argued october decided june certiorari to the supreme court of california mr justice powell announced the judgment of the court this case presents a challenge to the special admissions program of the petitioner the medical school of the university of california at davis which is designed to assure the admission of a specified number of students from certain minority groups the superior court of california sustained respondent s challenge holding that petitioner s program violated the california constitution title vi of the civil rights act of u s c d et seq and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment the court enjoined petitioner from considering respondent s race or the race of any other applicant in making admissions decisions it refused however to order respondent s admission to the medical school holding that he had not carried his burden of proving that he would have been admitted but for the constitutional and statutory violations the supreme court of california affirmed those portions of the trial court s judgment declaring the special admissions program unlawful and enjoining petitioner from considering the race of any applicant it modified that portion of the judgment denying respondent s requested injunction and directed the trial court to order his admission for the reasons stated in the following opinion i believe that so much of the judgment of the california court as holds petitioner s special admissions program unlawful and directs that respondent be admitted to the medical school must be affirmed for the reasons expressed in a separate opinion my brothers the chief justice mr justice stewart mr justice rehnquist and mr justice stevens concur in this judgment i also conclude for the reasons stated in the following opinion that the portion of the court s judgment enjoining petitioner from according any consideration to race in its admissions process must be reversed for reasons expressed in separate opinions my brothers mr justice brennan mr justice white mr justice marshall and mr justice blackmun concur in this judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part ithe medical school of the university of california at davis opened in with an entering class of students in the size of the entering class was increased to students a level at which it remains no admissions program for disadvantaged or minority students existed when the school opened and the first class contained three asians but no blacks no mexican americans and no american indians over the next two years the faculty devised a special admissions program to increase the representation of disadvantaged students in each medical school class the special program consisted of a separate admissions system operating in coordination with the regular admissions process under the regular admissions procedure a candidate could submit his application to the medical school beginning in july of the year preceding the academic year for which admission was sought record because of the large number of applications the admissions committee screened each one to select candidates for further consideration candidates whose overall undergraduate grade point averages fell below on a scale of were summarily rejected id at about one out of six applicants was invited for a personal interview ibid following the interviews each candidate was rated on a scale of to by his interviewers and four other members of the admissions committee the rating embraced the interviewers summaries the candidate s overall grade point average grade point average in science courses scores on the medical college admissions test mcat letters of recommendation extracurricular activities and other biographical data id at the ratings were added together to arrive at each candidate s benchmark score since five committee members rated each candidate in a perfect score was in six members rated each candidate so that a perfect score was the full committee then reviewed the file and scores of each applicant and made offers of admission on a rolling basis the chairman was responsible for placing names on the waiting list they were not placed in strict numerical order instead the chairman had discretion to include persons with special skills id at the special admissions program operated with a separate committee a majority of whom were members of minority groups id at on the application form candidates were asked to indicate whether they wished to be considered as economically and or educationally disadvantaged applicants on the form the question was whether they wished to be considered as members of a minority group which the medical school apparently viewed as blacks chicanos asians and american indians id at if these questions were answered affirmatively the application was forwarded to the special admissions committee no formal definition of disadvantaged was ever produced id at but the chairman of the special committee screened each application to see whether it reflected economic or educational deprivation having passed this initial hurdle the applications then were rated by the special committee in a fashion similar to that used by the general admissions committee except that special candidates did not have to meet the grade point average cutoff applied to regular applicants about one fifth of the total number of special applicants were invited for interviews in and following each interview the special committee assigned each special applicant a benchmark score the special committee then presented its top choices to the general admissions committee the latter did not rate or compare the special candidates against the general applicants id at but could reject recommended special candidates for failure to meet course requirements or other specific deficiencies id at the special committee continued to recommend special applicants until a number prescribed by faculty vote were admitted while the overall class size was still the prescribed number was in and when the class size had doubled to the prescribed number of special admissions also doubled to id at from the year of the increase in class size through the special program resulted in the admission of black students mexican americans and asians for a total of minority students over the same period the regular admissions program produced black mexican americans and asians for a total of minority students although disadvantaged whites applied to the special program in large numbers see n supra none received an offer of admission through that process indeed in at least the special committee explicitly considered only disadvantaged special applicants who were members of one of the designated minority groups record allan bakke is a white male who applied to the davis medical school in both and in both years bakke s application was considered under the general admissions program and he received an interview his interview was with dr theodore c west who considered bakke a very desirable applicant to the medical school id at despite a strong benchmark score of out of bakke was rejected his application had come late in the year and no applicants in the general admissions process with scores below were accepted after bakke s application was completed id at there were four special admissions slots unfilled at that time however for which bakke was not considered id at after his rejection bakke wrote to dr george h lowrey associate dean and chairman of the admissions committee protesting that the special admissions program operated as a racial and ethnic quota id at bakke s application was completed early in the year id at his student interviewer gave him an overall rating of finding him friendly well tempered conscientious and delightful to speak with id at his faculty interviewer was by coincidence the same dr lowrey to whom he had written in protest of the special admissions program dr lowrey found bakke rather limited in his approach to the problems of the medical profession and found disturbing bakke s very definite opinions which were based more on his personal viewpoints than upon a study of the total problem id at dr lowrey gave bakke the lowest of his six ratings an his total was out of id at again bakke s application was rejected in neither year did the chairman of the admissions committee dr lowrey exercise his discretion to place bakke on the waiting list id at in both years applicants were admitted under the special program with grade point averages mcat scores and benchmark scores significantly lower than bakke s after the second rejection bakke filed the instant suit in the superior court of california he sought mandatory injunctive and declaratory relief compelling his admission to the medical school he alleged that the medical school s special admissions program operated to exclude him from the school on the basis of his race in violation of his rights under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment art i of the california constitution and of title vi of the civil rights act of stat u s c d the university cross complained for a declaration that its special admissions program was lawful the trial court found that the special program operated as a racial quota because minority applicants in the special program were rated only against one another record and places in the class of were reserved for them id at declaring that the university could not take race into account in making admissions decisions the trial court held the challenged program violative of the federal constitution the state constitution and title vi the court refused to order bakke s admission however holding that he had failed to carry his burden of proving that he would have been admitted but for the existence of the special program bakke appealed from the portion of the trial court judgment denying him admission and the university appealed from the decision that its special admissions program was unlawful and the order enjoining it from considering race in the processing of applications the supreme court of california transferred the case directly from the trial court because of the importance of the issues involved cal d p d the california court accepted the findings of the trial court with respect to the university s program because the special admissions program involved a racial classification the supreme court held itself bound to apply strict scrutiny id at p d at it then turned to the goals the university presented as justifying the special program although the court agreed that the goals of integrating the medical profession and increasing the number of physicians willing to serve members of minority groups were compelling state interests id at p d at it concluded that the special admissions program was not the least intrusive means of achieving those goals without passing on the state constitutional or the federal statutory grounds cited in the trial court s judgment the california court held that the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment required that no applicant may be rejected because of his race in favor of another who is less qualified as measured by standards applied without regard to race id at p d at turning to bakke s appeal the court ruled that since bakke had established that the university had discriminated against him on the basis of his race the burden of proof shifted to the university to demonstrate that he would not have been admitted even in the absence of the special admissions program id at p d at the court analogized bakke s situation to that of a plaintiff under title vii of the civil rights act of u s c e ed supp v see e g franks v bowman transportation co u s cal d at p d at on this basis the court initially ordered a remand for the purpose of determining whether under the newly allocated burden of proof bakke would have been admitted to either the or the entering class in the absence of the special admissions program app a to application for stay in its petition for rehearing below however the university conceded its inability to carry that burden app b to application for stay a a the california court thereupon amended its opinion to direct that the trial court enter judgment ordering bakke s admission to the medical school cal d at p d at that order was stayed pending review in this court u s we granted certiorari to consider the important constitutional issue u s iiin this court the parties neither briefed nor argued the applicability of title vi of the civil rights act of rather as had the california court they focused exclusively upon the validity of the special admissions program under the equal protection clause because it was possible however that a decision on title vi might obviate resort to constitutional interpretation see ashwander v tva u s concurring opinion we requested supplementary briefing on the statutory issue u s aat the outset we face the question whether a right of action for private parties exists under title vi respondent argues that there is a private right of action invoking the test set forth in cort v ash u s he contends that the statute creates a federal right in his favor that legislative history reveals an intent to permit private actions that such actions would further the remedial purposes of the statute and that enforcement of federal rights under the civil rights act generally is not relegated to the states in addition he cites several lower court decisions which have recognized or assumed the existence of a private right of action petitioner denies the existence of a private right of action arguing that the sole function of see n supra was to establish a predicate for administrative action under stat u s c d in its view administrative curtailment of federal funds under that section was the only sanction to be imposed upon recipients that violated petitioner also points out that title vi contains no explicit grant of a private right of action in contrast to titles ii iii iv and vii of the same statute u s c a a b c and e f ed and supp v we find it unnecessary to resolve this question in the instant case the question of respondent s right to bring an action under title vi was neither argued nor decided in either of the courts below and this court has been hesitant to review questions not addressed below mcgoldrick v compagnie generale transatlantique u s see also massachusetts v westcott u s cardinale v louisiana u s cf singleton v wulff u s we therefore do not address this difficult issue similarly we need not pass upon petitioner s claim that private plaintiffs under title vi must exhaust administrative remedies we assume only for the purposes of this case that respondent has a right of action under title vi see lau v nichols u s n stewart j concurring in result bthe language of stat like that of the equal protection clause is majestic in its sweep no person in the united states shall on the ground of race color or national origin be excluded from participation in be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance the concept of discrimination like the phrase equal protection of the laws is susceptible of varying interpretations for as mr justice holmes declared a word is not a crystal transparent and unchanged it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in color and content according to the circumstances and the time in which it is used towne v eisner u s we must therefore seek whatever aid is available in determining the precise meaning of the statute before us train v colorado public interest research group u s quoting united states v american trucking assns u s examination of the voluminous legislative history of title vi reveals a congressional intent to halt federal funding of entities that violate a prohibition of racial discrimination similar to that of the constitution although isolated statements of various legislators taken out of context can be marshaled in support of the proposition that enacted a purely color blind scheme without regard to the reach of the equal protection clause these comments must be read against the background of both the problem that congress was addressing and the broader view of the statute that emerges from a full examination of the legislative debates the problem confronting congress was discrimination against negro citizens at the hands of recipients of federal moneys indeed the color blindness pronouncements cited in the margin at n generally occur in the midst of extended remarks dealing with the evils of segregation in federally funded programs over and over again proponents of the bill detailed the plight of negroes seeking equal treatment in such programs there simply was no reason for congress to consider the validity of hypothetical preferences that might be accorded minority citizens the legislators were dealing with the real and pressing problem of how to guarantee those citizens equal treatment in addressing that problem supporters of title vi repeatedly declared that the bill enacted constitutional principles for example representative celler the chairman of the house judiciary committee and floor manager of the legislation in the house emphasized this in introducing the bill the bill would offer assurance that hospitals financed by federal money would not deny adequate care to negroes it would prevent abuse of food distribution programs whereby negroes have been known to be denied food surplus supplies when white persons were given such food it would assure negroes the benefits now accorded only white students in programs of high er education financed by federal funds it would in short assure the existing right to equal treatment in the enjoyment of federal funds it would not destroy any rights of private property or freedom of association cong rec emphasis added other sponsors shared representative celler s view that title vi embodied constitutional principles in the senate senator humphrey declared that the purpose of title vi was to insure that federal funds are spent in accordance with the constitution and the moral sense of the nation id at senator ribicoff agreed that title vi embraced the constitutional standard basically there is a constitutional restriction against discrimination in the use of federal funds and title vi simply spells out the procedure to be used in enforcing that restriction id at other senators expressed similar views further evidence of the incorporation of a constitutional standard into title vi appears in the repeated refusals of the legislation s supporters precisely to define the term discrimination opponents sharply criticized this failure but proponents of the bill merely replied that the meaning of discrimination would be made clear by reference to the constitution or other existing law for example senator humphrey noted the relevance of the constitution as i have said the bill has a simple purpose that purpose is to give fellow citizensnegroesthe same rights and opportunities that white people take for granted this is no more than what was preached by the prophets and by christ himself it is no more than what our constitution guarantees id at in view of the clear legislative intent title vi must be held to proscribe only those racial classifications that would violate the equal protection clause or the fifth amendment iiiapetitioner does

level of judicial scrutiny to be applied to the special admissions program petitioner argues that the court below erred in applying strict scrutiny as this inexact term has been applied in our cases that level of review petitioner asserts should be reserved for classifications that disadvantage discrete and insular minorities see united states v carolene products co u s n respondent on the other hand contends that the california court correctly rejected the notion that the degree of judicial scrutiny accorded a particular racial or ethnic classification hinges upon membership in a discrete and insular minority and duly recognized that the rights established by the fourteenth amendment are personal rights shelley v kraemer u s en route to this crucial battle over the scope of judicial review the parties fight a sharp preliminary action over the proper characterization of the special admissions program petitioner prefers to view it as establishing a goal of minority representation in the medical school respondent echoing the courts below labels it a racial quota this semantic distinction is beside the point the special admissions program is undeniably a classification based on race and ethnic background to the extent that there existed a pool of at least minimally qualified minority applicants to fill the special admissions seats white applicants could compete only for seats in the entering class rather than the open to minority applicants whether this limitation is described as a quota or a goal it is a line drawn on the basis of race and ethnic status the guarantees of the fourteenth amendment extend to all persons its language is explicit no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws it is settled beyond question that the rights created by the first section of the fourteenth amendment are by its terms guaranteed to the individual the rights established are personal rights shelley v kraemer supra at accord missouri ex rel gaines v canada supra at mccabe v atchison t s f r co u s the guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one thing when applied to one individual and something else when applied to a person of another color if both are not accorded the same protection then it is not equal nevertheless petitioner argues that the court below erred in applying strict scrutiny to the special admissions program because white males such as respondent are not a discrete and insular minority requiring extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process carolene products co supra at n this rationale however has never been invoked in our decisions as a prerequisite to subjecting racial or ethnic distinctions to strict scrutiny nor has this court held that discreteness and insularity constitute necessary preconditions to a holding that a particular classification is invidious see e g skinner v oklahoma ex rel williamson u s carrington v rash u s these characteristics may be relevant in deciding whether or not to add new types of classifications to the list of suspect categories or whether a particular classification survives close examination see e g massachusetts board of retirement v murgia u s age san antonio independent school dist v rodriguez u s wealth graham v richardson u s aliens racial and ethnic classifications however are subject to stringent examination without regard to these additional characteristics we declared as much in the first cases explicitly to recognize racial distinctions as suspect distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality hirabayashi u s at a ll legal restrictions which curtail the civil rights of a single racial group are immediately suspect that is not to say that all such restrictions are unconstitutional it is to say that courts must subject them to the most rigid scrutiny korematsu u s at the court has never questioned the validity of those pronouncements racial and ethnic distinctions of any sort are inherently suspect and thus call for the most exacting judicial examination bthis perception of racial and ethnic distinctions is rooted in our nation s constitutional and demographic history the court s initial view of the fourteenth amendment was that its one pervading purpose was the freedom of the slave race the security and firm establishment of that freedom and the protection of the newly made freeman and citizen from the oppressions of those who had formerly exercised dominion over him slaughter house cases wall the equal protection clause however was v irtually strangled in infancy by post civil war judicial reactionism it was relegated to decades of relative desuetude while the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment after a short germinal period flourished as a cornerstone in the court s defense of property and liberty of contract see e g mugler v kansas u s allgeyer v louisiana u s lochner v new york u s in that cause the fourteenth amendment s one pervading purpose was displaced see e g plessy v ferguson u s it was only as the era of substantive due process came to a close see e g nebbia v new york u s west coast hotel co v parrish u s that the equal protection clause began to attain a genuine measure of vitality see e g united states v carolene products u s skinner v oklahoma ex rel williamson supra by that time it was no longer possible to peg the guarantees of the fourteenth amendment to the struggle for equality of one racial minority during the dormancy of the equal protection clause the united states had become a nation of minorities each had to struggle and to some extent struggles still to overcome the prejudices not of a monolithic majority but of a majority composed of various minority groups of whom it was saidperhaps unfairly in many cases that a shared characteristic was a willingness to disadvantage other groups as the nation filled with the stock of many lands the reach of the clause was gradually extended to all ethnic groups seeking protection from official discrimination see strauder v west virginia u s celtic irishmen dictum yick wo v hopkins u s chinese truax v raich u s austrian resident aliens korematsu supra japanese hernandez v texas u s mexican americans the guarantees of equal protection said the court in yick wo are universal in their application to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction without regard to any differences of race of color or of nationality and the equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws u s at although many of the framers of the fourteenth amendment conceived of its primary function as bridging the vast distance between members of the negro race and the white majority slaughter house cases supra the amendment itself was framed in universal terms without reference to color ethnic origin or condition of prior servitude as this court recently remarked in interpreting the civil rights act to extend to claims of racial discrimination against white persons the th congress was intent upon establishing in the federal law a broader principle than would have been necessary simply to meet the particular and immediate plight of the newly freed negro slaves mcdonald v santa fe trail transportation co u s and that legislation was specifically broadened in to ensure that all persons not merely citizens would enjoy equal rights under the law see runyon v mccrary u s white j dissenting indeed it is not unlikely that among the framers were many who would have applauded a reading of the equal protection clause that states a principle of universal application and is responsive to the racial ethnic and cultural diversity of the nation see e g cong globe th cong st sess remarks of rep niblack id at remarks of sen conness id th cong d sess remarks of sen howe fourteenth amendment protect s classes from class legislation see also bickel the original understanding and the segregation decision harv l rev over the past years this court has embarked upon the crucial mission of interpreting the equal protection clause with the view of assuring to all persons the protection of equal laws yick wo supra at in a nation confronting a legacy of slavery and racial discrimination see e g shelley v kraemer u s brown v board of education u s hills v gautreaux u s because the landmark decisions in this area arose in response to the continued exclusion of negroes from the mainstream of american society they could be characterized as involving discrimination by the majority white race against the negro minority but they need not be read as depending upon that characterization for their results it suffices to say that o ver the years this court has consistently repudiated d istinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry as being odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality loving v virginia u s quoting hirabayashi u s at petitioner urges us to adopt for the first time a more restrictive view of the equal protection clause and hold that discrimination against members of the white majority cannot be suspect if its purpose can be characterized as benign the clock of our liberties however cannot be turned back to brown v board of education supra at accord loving v virginia supra at it is far too late to argue that the guarantee of equal protection to all persons permits the recognition of special wards entitled to a degree of protection greater than that accorded others the fourteenth amendment is not directed solely against discrimination due to a two class theory that is based upon differences between white and negro hernandez u s at once the artificial line of a two class theory of the fourteenth amendment is put aside the difficulties entailed in varying the level of judicial review according to a perceived preferred status of a particular racial or ethnic minority are intractable the concepts of majority and minority necessarily reflect temporary arrangements and political judgments as observed above the white majority itself is composed of various minority groups most of which can lay claim to a history of prior discrimination at the hands of the state and private individuals not all of these groups can receive preferential treatment and corresponding judicial tolerance of distinctions drawn in terms of race and nationality for then the only majority left would be a new minority of white anglo saxon protestants there is no principled basis for deciding which groups would merit heightened judicial solicitude and which would not courts would be asked to evaluate the extent of the prejudice and consequent harm suffered by various minority groups those whose societal injury is thought to exceed some arbitrary level of tolerability then would be entitled to preferential classifications at the expense of individuals belonging to other groups those classifications would be free from exacting judicial scrutiny as these preferences began to have their desired effect and the consequences of past discrimination were undone new judicial rankings would be necessary the kind of variable sociological and political analysis necessary to produce such rankings simply does not lie within the judicial competenceeven if they otherwise were politically feasible and socially desirable moreover there are serious problems of justice connected with the idea of preference itself first it may not always be clear that a so called preference is in fact benign courts may be asked to validate burdens imposed upon individual members of a particular group in order to advance the group s general interest see united jewish organizations v carey u s at brennan j concurring in part nothing in the constitution supports the notion that individuals may be asked to suffer otherwise impermissible burdens in order to enhance the societal standing of their ethnic groups second preferential programs may only reinforce common stereotypes holding that certain groups are unable to achieve success without special protection based on a factor having no relationship to individual worth see defunis v odegaard u s douglas j dissenting third there is a measure of inequity in forcing innocent persons in respondent s position to bear the burdens of redressing grievances not of their making by hitching the meaning of the equal protection

fishes crans of herrings drafts of eels codlings creels of fingerlings purple seagems and playful insects and heroes voyage from afar to woo them from eblana to slievemargy the peerless princes of

scruff of the neck and by jesus he near throttled him the figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero from shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse ulex europeus the widewinged nostrils from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest the eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower a powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble he wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes beneath this he wore trews of deerskin roughly stitched with gut his nether extremities were encased in high balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast from his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet

terry boy says alf terence o ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers bungiveagh and bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats cunning as the sons of deathless leda for they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil those cunning brothers lords of the vat then did you chivalrous terence hand forth as to the manner born that nectarous beverage and you offered

christ says alf begob he was what you might call flabbergasted in the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels in reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana alavatar hatakalda wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that mars and jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power it was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was we greet you friends of earth who are still in the body mind c k doesn t pile it on it was ascertained that the reference was to mr cornelius kelleher manager of messrs h j o neill s popular funeral establishment a personal friend of the defunct who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to cullen s to be soled only as the heels were still good he stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction he is gone from mortal haunts o dignam sun of our morning fleet was his foot on the bracken patrick of the beamy brow wail banba with your wind and wail o ocean with your whirlwind there he is again says the citizen staring out who says i bloom says he he s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes and

well says alf trying to pass it off he s over all his troubles but bob doran shouts out of him he s a bloody ruffian i say to take away poor little willy dignam terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet that they didn t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises and bob doran starts doing the weeps about paddy dignam true as you re there the finest man says he snivelling the finest purest character the tear is bloody near your eye talking through his bloody hat fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married mooney the bumbailiff s daughter mother kept a kip in hardwicke street that used to be stravaging about the landings bantam lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her exposing her person open to all comers fair field and no favour the noblest the truest says he and he s gone poor little willy poor little paddy dignam and mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven old garryowen started growling again at bloom that was skeezing round the door come in come on he won t eat you says the citizen so bloom slopes in with his cod s eye on the dog and he asks terry was martin cunningham there o christ m keown says joe reading one of the letters listen to this will you and he starts reading out one hunter street liverpool to the high sheriff of dublin dublin honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged joe gann in bootle jail on the of febuary and i hanged show us joe says i private arthur chace for fowl

the citizen and the dirty scrawl of the wretch says joe here says he take them to hell out of my sight alf hello bloom says he what will you have so they started arguing about the point bloom saying he wouldn t and he couldn t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he d just take a cigar gob he s a prudent member and no mistake give us one of your prime stinkers terry says joe and alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it they re all barbers says he from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses and he was telling us there s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull in the dark land they bide the vengeful knights of the razor their deadly coil they grasp yea and therein they lead to erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for i will on nowise suffer it even so saith the lord so they started talking about capital punishment and of course bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time i m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about i don t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on there s one thing it hasn t a deterrent effect on says alf what s that says joe the poor bugger s tool that s being hanged says alf that so says joe god s truth says alf i heard that from the head warder that was in kilmainham when they hanged joe brady the invincible he told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker ruling passion strong in death says joe as someone said that can be explained by science says bloom it s only a natural phenomenon don t you see because on account of the and then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon the distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would according to the best approved tradition of medical science be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis so of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new ireland and new this that and the other talking about new ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs and round he goes to bob doran that was standing alf a half one sucking up for what he could get so of course bob doran starts doing the bloody fool with him give us the paw give the paw doggy good old doggy give the paw here give us the paw arrah bloody end to the paw he d paw and alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training

it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more near ate the tin and all hungry bloody mongrel and the citizen and bloom having an argument about the point the brothers sheares and wolfe tone beyond on arbour hill and robert emmet and die for your country the tommy moore touch about sara curran and she s far from the land and bloom of course with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face phenomenon the fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley time they were stopping up in the city arms pisser burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing b zique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk and one time he led him the rounds of dublin and by the holy farmer he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings if the three women didn t near roast him it s a queer story the old one bloom s wife and mrs o dowd that kept the hotel jesus i had to laugh at pisser burke taking them off chewing the fat and bloom with his but don t you see and but on the other hand and sure more be token the lout i m told was in power s after the blender s round in cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment phenomenon the memory of the dead says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at bloom ay ay says joe you don t grasp my point says bloom what i mean is sinn fein says the citizen sinn fein amhain the friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us the last farewell was affecting in the extreme from the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance the deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle a torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons a posse of dublin metropolitan police superintended by the chief commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the york street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by speranza s plaintive muse special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents considerable amusement was caused by the favourite dublin streetsingers l n h n and m ll g n who sang the night before larry was stretched in their usual mirth provoking fashion our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies the children of the male and female foundling hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the little sisters of the poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely

motherfuckers his pops dead but if he was here he d say you stupid motherfucker tell him he is not a thug stop cause he ain t got the love and punch him in his mug for gettin blood on these boxing gloves now i mma tell you my whole plan before i got in here was to get anybody who participated in this smack url event from math hoffa cortez hollow da don t rex murda mook k shine conceited calicoe x factor young miles ms dolarz rich hustle charlie clips dna and his new smile the fuck outta here you might also like the crowd in webster hall starts loudly booing e ness for roughly seconds aight ness vs dna the fuck i got demoted cause why would smack put a puppet in the ring wit a poet this kid been rappin the same way since the first day we seen him but then he talk shit bout every battle league that breastfeed him like he had battles on smack maybe one or two on grind time just to cock ride to king of the dot talkin bout he top come on now stop keep it a bean you know that s not live you just mad louie wouldn t let you into the dot mobb and lemme tell you somethin bout the dot mobb them three niggas got nine lives cause no matter how many times somebody go upside they head or beat em in a battle them three niggas will not die this shit ain t payin my the crowd gets back on e ness s side as they laugh and cheer at that bar this shit ain t payin my bills so i m gon cut a side deal to walk down on him like bishop when he popped steel see mook rex and k shine think they the dipset them pussies make my dick wet i m just surprised charlie clips ain t make you his bitch yet while e ness raps that last bar the crowd reacts in shock and disgust to the bar just before it with more than a few people yelling pause cause mook ain t cam don t cut me off cause mook ain t cam e ness waits another eight seconds for the crowd to quiet down enough so he can start rapping again cause mook ain t cam and rex ain t jimmy and k shine can t be juelz cause his first name kenny don t wanna hear them songs bout them skinnies and you givin out shots if you can t take any now back to dna chill it s gon be ok cause when i m done with dna y all gon call him doa let s talk about dna he ll never win a vma he the type to swim with you from thirty five feet away let s break down dna s dna we all know he comes from a broken home one way mobile phone with the genetics of a retarded xy chromosome now y all came to see dna this dickhead in action or y all came to see me turn in the hulk and straight smash em cortez lame charlie has been them the two niggas supposed to be y all upper classmen hollow locked up so when i see him i m gon ask him are y all the black version of two and a half men see i know what you gon do you gon kick a few nameflips try to spit the same shit ya step pops charlie clips got in the game with oh wait that ain t it you gon talk about puff how he had me walk up for some cheese cake you gon say some slick shit about philly how you gon eat me like a cheese steak you gon freestyle you gon improvise but that s committing genocide cause i m a livin legend nigga you s the living lie crowd boos what you gon say dna that your real name is lloyd mathis and you ugly than a motherfucker i just know that shirt you had on when you battled dizaster was snuggy than a motherfucker man i read you like a textbook right jab left hook no look pass from durant out to westbrook you ain t on my level i m dancin with the devil and ya man wanna wrestle like these hands ain t successful and i m so special and i m so special cause i can get personal and disrespectful round dna e ness summer madness hm it almost feels like i signed up for a death wish cause this the first time i m the favorite and he s the underdog so y all gon cheer for anything he says cause y all don t expect shit but if i come with making the band cheesecake and p diddy jokes i might see the respect switch so i guess going bar for bar s the only option i m left with i was supposed to battle mook lux and serius but they ain t wanna accept this so url work hard to get me on the card and i knew when i made it leave the rest sick once i said i ll take the making the band nigga they said well we can get him for a flight hotel and less chips so since smack milked him for what he s worth then it s only right i get rid of ness quick nesquik now let s talk about your career in the industry cause it s sad but this is what i gotta do to hurt you cause you had your chance to make the deaf jam def jam but bad boy jocked you from going universal atlantic didn t want you interscope didn t need you so royalty checks you would never see none looks like them labels gave everybody else a deal but forgot to gave e one e that s cause ya image is horrible and all ya songs is trash and every verse you spit is plane so a rs get bored and pass boardin pass now what got me mad is you actually had a chance to be signed star so since bad boy ain t never let you shine shyne it s only right i make you suffer behind bars e ness that shit wack that ain t bar for bar and speaking of prison once i grab that ratchet cock it back aim and pull it you won t have to spend a year in jail for you to take a bullet so you better die just see ars c a r when these hammers ll blast cause i run up and put a magnum on e like you ran outta gas e ness not today not today so keep

when i say i got the burner i m not talking about no cd see that one verse i wrote for p diddy for press play made me a very very very wealthy man the next day so the next time i hear one you faggots say he broke and he off point just go to number thirteen diddy rock featuring shawnna and timbaland off the press play joint if a nigga still frontin like i ain t made no money burger king bought the rights to the song for crowd interupts with boos nah nah nah nah right now he tryin to figure some shit he could rebuttal but this the second round so i mma make em see double they threw me dna cause

feel that i know smack gon try to play me cause he told you what he pay me but it don t make me or break me cause these guns is off safety crowd boos y all just bore me shotty blast karate class i m jason without the hockey mask why everytime somebody battle on smack they say bodybag niggas say zip it up niggas say landslide tsunami using subtitles giving smack handjobs niggas never step to me

that nigga would probably snuff you if black rob seen you that nigga probably cut you lil kim wouldn t give you head faith evans wouldn t touch you come to think of it nigga even jae millz said fuck

cheesecake line again say the cheesecake line again now he can go battle at queen of the ring round e ness dna stands for the dirtiest nigga alive this is the cleanest you have ever been and i m somewhat surprised now someone tell dna to open up his eyes cause when you taking niggas money that s a whole different high now we d all like to thank charlie clips for taking care of dna i woulda been his father if his mother had the e j well charlie i m truly sorry it had to be this way my llama like a fucking piranha i let it eat away see ya music is trash your mixtapes never sell only way you ll get a deal is if you take one to tell i don t know why the fuck they gave me you i m crazier than crazy glue yeah i ve been skating through since i ve been doing this before the yankees wore navy blue fuck rap you get smacked crowd boos wow y all niggas booing man y all niggas hating listen i m not even gonna finish that let him rap nah nah they fucking my shit up smack tries to calm the crowd down i don t know why the fuck they gave me you i m crazier than crazy glue yeah i ve been skating through since i ve been doing this before the yankees wore navy blue and fuck rap you get smrrracked look at what you made me do and you getting lazy too i seen ya last battle if that tech ain t jam in that third round my man woulda had you i say that to say this niggas like you i can t bang with why cause you only as tough as them niggas you hang with and y all gon hate when i say this when i say mook ain t the greatest cause mook ain t been talked about since math gave him a facelift word is math hoffa ain t no gat popper crowd boos i guess you held ya own but then you really did some faggot shit to kill see rone for rone bar for bar woulda beat you probably but what type of nigga you know tape a fake bomb to his body he ripped off his hoodie no t shirt no tanktop your whole career s been built off the glass you re a bankshop now let me tell you some more faggot shit when you battle big titus i mma expose this litte nigga for the people that didn t see it some super duper gay shit man i just couldn t believe it cause the first half of that second round was talking about that man penis now i mma tell you some more shit i found out about this nigga when i was coming up the highway this bum ass nigga tried to take charli baltimore out on a date to tgi friday now you need to beg one of the labels to give you some money and stop trying to treat these hoes to a for this faggot just cut his dick off and sit next rick ross wear a bunch of lip gloss go and get his shit tossed this fight was fixed don t you feel like you ripped off scrolling through them call logs looking through them miss calls ask ya man should you battle ness he told you nig nah i fuck with you and everything but i m not going with y all fucking with him you done ran into a brick wall pitfall chris paul when he get his shit off these diamonds are forever say something clever cause nobody what you say i m gon translate it better and that bullshit move you threw on youtube was the dumbest shit i seen in my life to get views now go ahead let him have it let him have it round dna e ness round one and two i already show y all who s the better rapper but this the part where we analyze your career like a book and go through every chapter see i done mentioned cheesecake making the band and p diddy cause y all would say it s predictable and call it wack but ask yourself this what else has e ness done to put his career on the map so instead of saying i m being predictable tell this man he hasn t progressed i bet you never thought of that cause if in ten years you only known for three things now whose fault is this see this battle rap world started off as a network and over time it became community so to see someone make it we should all be happy and spread the unity but i m angry at what you could ve been and for that you a fool to me cause every battle rapper wouldve died for that opportunity so as a man as a father as a artist you are useless you don t blog do videos or put out any music so how could you get mad if we mention cheese cake making a band p diddy or you getting fucking shelved when you had several opportunities in your career to do something else that s why the stuff i m telling you right now is some of the realest shit there s a hundred dudes that should be in your spot cause they was really out killing shit iron solomon and mysonne joked about that cheese cake nigga i m dead serious they started something but with this scheme right here i mma finish it i ll bet everybody you know gave you a pound when you made it on that show cause they thought you was all great little did they know you were cause after biggie died diddy had lost faith thought ya music was bananas but you realized it wasn t by your fourth tape so he shelved you on your birthday and you went into depression and started pitching that raw base but have to provide for your kids so you traded in them karats started gaining more weight do anything to make sure they get food all month and make sure they all safe now y all don t need a pineapple to see his life s upside down and in the wrong place so going to juniors made sense cause in the end all diddy ever gave you was short cake now i want no applause for that so don t start shaking my hand that was just chapter one chapter two is making the band when diddy first started fucking with you he liked for your aggressiveness and your passion so much to the point that out of everyone on that show he made you the captain thought you would have a bright future thought would move in the world far so how the fuck did you let chopper become more popular than you on world star e ness fuck outta here you don t do no shows don t put out no mixtapes you ain t seeing bling and babs is more popular than you in battle rap off of hosting queen of the ring now mysonne and iron solomon joked about the band but nigga i m dead serious they started something but with this scheme right here i mma finish it you see your career is like the internet it started off at a high speed and you became the man quick but made a lot of bad connections so all of puff s plans switched lost every industry friend nobody to dial up and all of ya fans dipped and now got the lowest buzz online out of anyone you was in that band with bandwidth but i don t want no cheers for that so don t start making mad noise cause that was chapter two chapter three is bad boy now clearly puff don t fuck with you or you don t know math boy cause that chain you got says b that lets me know you don t know how to add boy e ness it s a l nigga loch ness loch ness get it b add boy that equals bad boy for the fact your chain doesn t say that that lets me know you doing bad boy did i speed it up too fast am i going too fast boy looks like puff and no one on that label fuck with you on bad boy you should palm smacked til you fall cause out of everybody you got the worse contract of them all if they woulda gave that to black rob he woulda say whoa whoa whoa whoa g dep woulda asked for a special delivery and been gone mase woulda hopped on his horse and carriage as soon as that bread s gone would say it s over now faith evans was too head strong biggie looked you dead in the eye and told you you dead wrong now in conclusion to my third round as y all see i killed him e ness is deceased now finally this young man can start resting in peace it s round three it s getting hot in here and off the career choices you made you got yourself the fuck outta here embed,"['rex', 'forever', 'trust', 'dog', 'drop', 'laugh', 'fan', 'banana', 'spend', 'wig', 'whip', 'mile', 'mad', 'suffer', 'hurt', 'raw', 'pop', 'origin', 'hot', 'die',

some young woman of notorious behaviour he had only just been protesting against luzhin s calumny and declaring that he had seen the girl last night for the first time and suddenly she had walked in he remembered too that he had not protested against the expression of notorious behaviour all this passed vaguely and fleetingly through his brain but looking at her more intently he saw that the humiliated creature was so humiliated that he felt suddenly sorry for her when she made a movement to retreat in terror it sent a pang to his heart i did not expect you he said hurriedly with a look that made her stop please sit down you come no doubt from katerina ivanovna allow me not there sit here at sonia s entrance razumihin who had been sitting on one of raskolnikov s three chairs close to the door got up to allow her to enter raskolnikov had at first shown her the place on the sofa where zossimov had been sitting but feeling that the sofa which served him as a bed was too familiar a place he hurriedly motioned her to razumihin s chair you sit here he said to razumihin putting him on the sofa sonia sat down almost shaking with terror and looked timidly at the two ladies it was evidently almost inconceivable to herself that she could sit down beside them at the thought of it she was so frightened that she hurriedly got up again and in utter confusion addressed raskolnikov i i have come for one minute forgive me for disturbing you she began falteringly i come from katerina ivanovna and she had no one to send katerina ivanovna told me to beg you to be at the service in the morning at mitrofanievsky and then to us to her to do her the honour she told me to beg you sonia stammered and ceased speaking i will try certainly most certainly answered raskolnikov he too stood up and he too faltered and could not finish his sentence please sit down he said suddenly i want to talk to you you are perhaps in a hurry but please be so kind spare me two minutes and he drew up a chair for her sonia sat down again and again timidly she took a hurried frightened look at the two ladies and dropped her eyes raskolnikov s pale face flushed a shudder passed over him his eyes glowed mother he said firmly and insistently this is sofya semyonovna marmeladov the daughter of that unfortunate mr marmeladov who was run over yesterday before my eyes and of whom i was just telling you pulcheria alexandrovna glanced at sonia and slightly screwed up her eyes in spite of her embarrassment before rodya s urgent and challenging look she could not deny herself that satisfaction dounia gazed gravely and intently into the poor girl s face and scrutinised her with perplexity sonia hearing herself introduced tried to raise her eyes again but was more embarrassed than ever i wanted to ask you said raskolnikov hastily how things were arranged yesterday you were not worried by the police for instance no that was all right it was too evident the cause of death they did not worry us only the lodgers are angry why at the body s remaining so long you see it is hot now so that to day they will carry it to the cemetery into the chapel until to morrow at first katerina ivanovna was unwilling but now she sees herself that it s necessary to day then she begs you to do us the honour to be in the church to morrow for the service and then to be present at the funeral lunch she is giving a funeral lunch yes just a little she told me to thank you very much for helping us yesterday but for you we should have had nothing for the funeral all at once her lips and chin began trembling but with an effort she controlled herself looking down again during the conversation raskolnikov watched her carefully she had a thin very thin pale little face rather irregular and angular with a sharp little nose and chin she could not have been called pretty but her blue eyes were so clear and when they lighted up there was such a kindliness and simplicity in her expression that one could not help being attracted her face and her whole figure indeed had another peculiar characteristic in spite of her eighteen years she looked almost a little girl almost a child and in some of her gestures this childishness seemed almost absurd but has katerina ivanovna been able to manage with such small means does she even mean to have a funeral lunch raskolnikov asked persistently keeping up the conversation the coffin will be plain of course and everything will be plain so it won t cost much katerina ivanovna and i have reckoned it all out so that there will be enough left and katerina ivanovna was very anxious it should be so you know one can t it s a comfort to her she is like that you know i understand i understand of course why do you look at my room like that my mother has just said it is like a tomb you gave us everything yesterday sonia said suddenly in reply in a loud rapid whisper and again she looked down in confusion her lips and chin were trembling once more she had been struck at once by raskolnikov s poor surroundings and now these words broke out spontaneously a silence followed there was a light in dounia s eyes and even pulcheria alexandrovna looked kindly at sonia rodya she said getting up we shall have dinner together of course come dounia and you rodya had better go for a little walk and then rest and lie down before you come to see us i am afraid we have exhausted you yes yes i ll come he answered getting up fussily but i have something to see to but surely you will have dinner together cried razumihin looking in surprise at raskolnikov what do you mean yes yes i am coming of course of course and you stay a minute you do not want him just now do you mother or perhaps i am taking him from you oh no no and will you dmitri prokofitch do us the favour of dining with us please do added dounia razumihin bowed positively radiant for one moment they were all strangely embarrassed good bye rodya that is till we meet i do not like saying good bye good bye nastasya ah i have said good bye again pulcheria alexandrovna meant to greet sonia too but it somehow failed to come off and she went in a flutter out of the room but avdotya romanovna seemed to await her turn and following her mother out gave sonia an attentive courteous bow sonia in confusion gave a hurried frightened curtsy there was a look of poignant discomfort in her face as though avdotya romanovna s courtesy and attention were oppressive and painful to her dounia good bye called raskolnikov in the passage give me your hand why i did give it to you have you forgotten said dounia turning warmly and awkwardly to him never mind give it to me again and he squeezed her fingers warmly dounia smiled flushed pulled her hand away and went off quite happy come that s capital he said to sonia going back and looking brightly at her god give peace to the dead the living have still to live that is right isn t it sonia looked surprised at the sudden brightness of his face he looked at her for some moments in silence the whole history of the dead father floated before his memory in those moments heavens dounia pulcheria alexandrovna began as soon as they were in the street i really feel relieved myself at coming away more at ease how little did i think yesterday in the train that i could ever be glad of that i tell you again mother he is still very ill don t you see it perhaps worrying about us upset him we must be patient and much much can be forgiven well you were not very patient pulcheria alexandrovna caught her up hotly and jealously do you know dounia i was looking at you two you are the very portrait of him and not so much in face as in soul you are both melancholy both morose and hot tempered both haughty and both generous surely he can t be an egoist dounia eh when i think of what is in store for us this evening my heart sinks don t be uneasy mother what must be will be dounia only think what a position we are in what if pyotr petrovitch breaks it off poor pulcheria alexandrovna blurted out incautiously he won t be worth much if he does answered dounia sharply and contemptuously we did well to come away pulcheria alexandrovna hurriedly broke in he was in a hurry about some business or other if he gets out and has a breath of air it is fearfully close in his room but where is one to get a breath of air here the very streets here feel like shut up rooms good heavens what a town stay this side they will crush you carrying something why it is a piano they have got i declare how they push i am very much afraid of that young woman too what young woman mother why that sofya semyonovna who was there just now why i have a presentiment dounia well you may believe it or not but as soon as she came in that very minute i felt that she was the chief cause of the trouble nothing of the sort cried dounia in vexation what nonsense with your presentiments mother he only made her acquaintance the evening before and he did not know her when she came in well you will see she worries me but you will see you will see i was so frightened she was gazing at me with those eyes i could scarcely sit still in my chair when he began introducing her do you remember it seems so strange but pyotr petrovitch writes like that about her and he introduces her to us to you so he must think a great deal of her people will write anything we were talked about and written about too have you forgotten i am sure that she is a good girl and that it is all nonsense god grant it may be and pyotr petrovitch is a contemptible slanderer dounia snapped out suddenly pulcheria alexandrovna was crushed the conversation was not resumed i will tell you what i want with you said raskolnikov drawing razumihin to the window then i will tell katerina ivanovna that you are coming sonia said hurriedly preparing to depart one minute sofya semyonovna we have no secrets you are not in our way i want to have another word or two with you listen he turned suddenly to razumihin again you know that what s his name porfiry petrovitch i should think so he is a relation why added the latter with interest is not he managing that case you know about that murder you were speaking about it yesterday yes well razumihin s eyes opened wide he was inquiring for people who had pawned things and i have some pledges there too trifles a ring my sister gave me as a keepsake when i left home and my father s silver watch they are only worth five or six roubles altogether but i value them so what am i to do now i do not want to lose the things especially the watch i was quaking just now for fear mother would ask to look at it when we spoke of dounia s watch it is the only thing of father s left us she would be ill if it were lost you know what women are so tell me what to do i know i ought to have given notice at the police station but would it not be better to go straight to porfiry eh what do you think the matter might be settled more quickly you see mother may ask for it before dinner certainly not to the police station certainly to porfiry razumihin shouted in extraordinary excitement well how glad i am let us go at once it is a couple of steps we shall be sure to find him very well let us go and he will be very very glad to make your acquaintance i have often talked to him of you at different times i was speaking of you yesterday let us go so you knew the old woman so that s it it is all turning out splendidly oh yes sofya ivanovna sofya semyonovna corrected raskolnikov sofya semyonovna this is my friend razumihin and he is a good man if you have to go now sonia was beginning not looking at razumihin at all and still more embarrassed let us go decided raskolnikov i will come to you to day sofya semyonovna only tell me where you live he was not exactly ill at ease but seemed hurried and avoided her eyes sonia gave her address and flushed as she did so they all went out together don t you lock up asked razumihin following him on to the stairs never answered raskolnikov i have been meaning to buy a lock for these two years people are happy who have no need of locks he said laughing to sonia they stood still in the gateway do you go to the right sofya semyonovna how did you find me by the way he added as though he wanted to say something quite different he wanted to look at her soft clear eyes but this was not easy why you gave your address to polenka yesterday polenka oh yes polenka that is the little girl she is your sister did i give her the address why had you forgotten no i remember i had heard my father speak of you only i did not know your name and he did not know it and now i came and as i had learnt your name i asked to day where does mr raskolnikov live i did not know you had only a room too good bye i will tell katerina ivanovna she was extremely glad to escape at last she went away looking down hurrying to get out of sight as soon as possible to walk the twenty steps to the turning on the right and to be at last alone and then moving rapidly along looking at no one noticing nothing to think to remember to meditate on every word every detail never never had she felt anything like this dimly and unconsciously a whole new world was opening before her she remembered suddenly that raskolnikov meant to come to her that day perhaps at once only not to day please not to day she kept muttering with a sinking heart as though entreating someone like a frightened child mercy to me to that room he will see oh dear she was not capable at that instant of noticing an unknown gentleman who was watching her and following at her heels he had accompanied her from the gateway at the moment when razumihin raskolnikov and she stood still at parting on the pavement this gentleman who was just passing started on hearing sonia s words and i asked where mr raskolnikov lived he turned a rapid but attentive look upon all three especially upon raskolnikov to whom sonia was speaking then looked back and noted the house all this was done in an instant as he passed and trying not to betray his interest he walked on more slowly as though waiting for something he was waiting for sonia he saw that they were parting and that sonia was going home home where i ve seen that face somewhere he thought i must find out at the turning he crossed over looked round and saw sonia coming the same way noticing nothing she turned the corner he followed her on the other side after about fifty paces he crossed over again overtook her and kept two or three yards behind her he was a man about fifty rather tall and thickly set with broad high shoulders which made him look as though he stooped a little he wore good and fashionable clothes and looked like a gentleman of position he carried a handsome cane which he tapped on the pavement at each step his gloves were spotless he had a broad rather pleasant face with high cheek bones and a fresh colour not often seen in petersburg his flaxen hair was still abundant and only touched here and there with grey and his thick square beard was even lighter than his hair his eyes were blue and had a cold and thoughtful look his lips were crimson he was a remarkedly well preserved man and looked much younger than his years when sonia came out on the canal bank they were the only two persons on the pavement he observed her dreaminess and preoccupation on reaching the house where she lodged sonia turned in at the gate he followed her seeming rather surprised in the courtyard she turned to the right corner bah muttered the unknown gentleman and mounted the stairs behind her only then sonia noticed him she reached the third storey turned down the passage and rang at no on the door was inscribed in chalk kapernaumov tailor bah the stranger repeated again wondering at the strange coincidence and he rang next door at no the doors were two or three yards apart you lodge at kapernaumov s he said looking at sonia and laughing he altered a waistcoat for me yesterday i am staying close here at madame resslich s how odd sonia looked at him attentively we are neighbours he went on gaily i only came to town the day before yesterday good bye for the present sonia made no reply the door opened and she slipped in she felt for some reason ashamed and uneasy on the way to porfiry s razumihin was obviously excited that s capital brother he repeated several times and i am glad i am glad what are you glad about raskolnikov thought to himself i didn t know that you pledged things at the old woman s too and was it long ago i mean was it long since you were there what a simple hearted fool he is when was it raskolnikov stopped still to recollect two or three days before her death it must have been but i am not going to redeem the things now he put in with a sort of hurried and conspicuous solicitude about the things i ve not more than a silver rouble left after last night s accursed delirium he laid special emphasis on the delirium yes yes razumihin hastened to agree with what was not clear then that s why you were stuck partly you know in your delirium you were continually mentioning some rings or chains yes yes that s clear it s all clear now hullo how that idea must have got about among them here this man will go to the stake for me and i find him delighted at having it cleared up why i spoke of rings in my delirium what a hold the idea must have on all of them shall we find him he asked suddenly oh yes razumihin answered quickly he is a nice fellow you will see brother rather clumsy that is to say he is a man of polished manners but i mean clumsy in a different sense he is an intelligent fellow very much so indeed but he has his own range of ideas he is incredulous sceptical cynical he likes to impose on people or rather to make fun of them his is the old circumstantial method but he understands his work thoroughly last year he cleared up a case of murder in which the police had hardly a clue he is very very anxious to make your acquaintance on what grounds is he so anxious oh it s not exactly you see since you ve been ill i happen to have mentioned you several times so when he heard about you about your being a law student and not able to finish your studies he said what a pity and so i concluded from everything together not only that yesterday zametov you know rodya i talked some nonsense on the way home to you yesterday when i was drunk i am afraid brother of your exaggerating it you see what that they think i am a madman maybe they are right he said with a constrained smile yes yes that is pooh no but all that i said and there was something else too it was all nonsense drunken nonsense but why are you apologising i am so sick of it all raskolnikov cried with exaggerated irritability it was partly assumed however i know i know i understand believe me i understand one s ashamed to speak of it if you are ashamed then don t speak of it both were silent razumihin was more than ecstatic and raskolnikov perceived it with repulsion he was alarmed too by what razumihin had just said about porfiry i shall have to pull a long face with him too he thought with a beating heart and he turned white and do it naturally too but the most natural thing would be to do nothing at all carefully do nothing at all no carefully would not be natural again oh well we shall see how it turns out we shall see directly is it a good thing to go or not the butterfly flies to the light my heart is beating that s what s bad in this grey house said razumihin the most important thing does porfiry know that i was at the old hag s flat yesterday and asked about the blood i must find that out instantly as soon as i go in find out from his face otherwise i ll find out if it s my ruin i say brother he said suddenly addressing razumihin with a sly smile i have been noticing all day that you seem to be curiously excited isn t it so excited not a bit of it said razumihin stung to the quick yes brother i assure you it s noticeable why you sat on your chair in a way you never do sit on the edge somehow and you seemed to be writhing all the time you kept jumping up for nothing one moment you were angry and the next your face looked like a sweetmeat you even blushed especially when you were invited to dinner you blushed awfully nothing of the sort nonsense what do you mean but why are you wriggling out of it like a schoolboy by jove there he s blushing again what a pig you are but why are you so shamefaced about it romeo stay i ll tell of you to day ha ha ha i ll make mother laugh and someone else too listen listen listen this is serious what next you fiend razumihin was utterly overwhelmed turning cold with horror what will you tell them come brother foo what a pig you are you are like a summer rose and if only you knew how it suits you a romeo over six foot high and how you ve washed to day you cleaned your nails i declare eh that s something unheard of why i do believe you ve got pomatum on your hair bend down pig raskolnikov laughed as though he could not restrain himself so laughing they entered porfiry petrovitch s flat this is what raskolnikov wanted from within they could be heard laughing as they came in still guffawing in the passage not a word here or i ll brain you razumihin whispered furiously seizing raskolnikov

grandmother s illness bergotte s illness the duke and the doctor decline and death of my grandmother the twittering of the birds at daybreak sounded insipid to fran oise every word uttered by the maids upstairs made her jump disturbed by all their running about she kept asking herself what they could be doing in other words we had moved certainly the servants had made no less noise in the attics of our old home but she knew them she had made of their comings and goings familiar events now she faced even silence with a strained attention and as our new neighbourhood appeared to be as quiet as the boulevard on to which we had hitherto looked had been noisy the song distinct at a distance when it was still quite faint like an orchestralmotif of a passer by brought tears to the eyes of a fran oise in exile and so if i had been tempted to laugh at her in her misery at having to leave a house in which she was so well respected on all sides and had packed her trunks with tears according to the use of combray declaring superior to all possible houses that which had been ours on the other hand i who found it as hard to assimilate new as i found it easy to abandon old conditions i felt myself drawn towards our old servant when i saw that this installation of herself in a building where she had not received from the hall porter who did not yet know us the marks of respect necessary to her moral wellbeing had brought her positively to the verge of dissolution she alone could understand what i was feeling certainly her young footman was not the person to do so for him who was as unlike the combray type as it was possible to conceive packing up moving living in another district were all like taking a holiday in which the novelty of one s surroundings gave one the same sense of refreshment as if one had actually travelled he thought he was in the country and a cold in the head afforded him as though he had been sitting in a draughty railway carriage the delicious sensation of having seen the world at each fresh sneeze he rejoiced that he had found so smart a place having always longed to be with people who travelled a lot and so without giving him a thought i went straight to fran oise who in return for my having laughed at her tears over a removal which had left me cold now shewed an icy indifference to my sorrow but because she shared it the sensibility claimed by neurotic people is matched by their egotism they cannot abide the flaunting by others of the sufferings to which they pay an ever increasing attention in themselves fran oise who would not allow the least of her own ailments to pass unnoticed if i were in pain would turn her head from me so that i should not have the satisfaction of seeing my sufferings pitied or so much as observed it was the same as soon as i tried to speak to her about our new house moreover having been obliged a day or two later to return to the house we had just left to retrieve some clothes which had been overlooked in our removal while i as a result of it had still a temperature and like a boa constrictor that has just swallowed an ox felt myself painfully distended by the sight of a long trunk which my eyes had still to digest fran oise with true feminine inconstancy came back saying that she had really thought she would stifle on our old boulevard it was so stuffy that she had found it quite a day s journey to get there that never had she seen such stairs that she would not go back to live there for a king s ransom not if you were to offer her millions a pure hypothesis and that everything everything that is to say to do with the kitchen and usual offices was much better fitted up in the new house which it is high time now that the reader should be told and told also that we had moved into it because my grandmother not having been at all well though we took care to keep this reason from her was in need of better air was a flat forming part of the h tel de guermantes at the age when a name offering us an image of the unknowable which we have poured into its mould while at the same moment it connotes for us also an existing place forces us accordingly to identify one with the other to such a point that we set out to seek in a city for a soul which it cannot embody but which we have no longer the power to expel from the sound of its name it is not only to towns and rivers that names give an individuality as do allegorical paintings it is not only the physical universe which they pattern with differences people with marvels there is the social universe also and so every historic house in town or country has its lady or its fairy as every forest has its spirit as there is a nymph for every stream sometimes hidden in the heart of its name the fairy is transformed to suit the life of our imagination by which she lives thus it was that the atmosphere in which mme de guermantes existed in me after having been for years no more than the shadow cast by a magic lantern slide or the light falling through a painted window began to let its colours fade when quite other dreams impregnated it with the bubbling coolness of her flowing streams and yet the fairy must perish if we come in contact with the real person to whom her name corresponds for that person the name then begins to reflect and she has in her nothing of the fairy the fairy may revive if we remove ourself from the person but if we remain in her presence the fairy definitely dies and with her the name as happened to the family of lusignan which was fated to become extinct on the day when the fairy m lusine should disappear then the name beneath our successive restorations of which we may end by finding as their original the beautiful portrait of a strange lady whom we are never to meet is nothing more than the mere photograph for identification to which we refer in order to decide whether we know whether or not we ought to bow to a person who passes us in the street but let a sensation from a bygone year like those recording instruments which preserve the sound and the manner of the various artists who have sung or played into them enable our memory to make us hear that name with the particular ring with which it then sounded in our ears then while the name itself has apparently not changed we feel the distance that separates the dreams which at different times its same syllables have meant to us for a moment from the clear echo of its warbling in some distant spring we can extract as from the little tubes which we use in painting the exact forgotten mysterious fresh tint of the days which we had believed ourself to be recalling when like a bad painter we were giving to the whole of our past spread out on the same canvas the tones conventional and all alike of our unprompted memory whereas on the contrary each of the moments that composed it employed for an original creation in a matchless harmony the colour of those days which we no longer know and which for that matter will still suddenly enrapture me if by any chance the name guermantes resuming for a moment after all these years the sound so different from its sound to day which it had for me on the day of mile percepied s marriage brings back to me that mauve so delicate almost too bright too new with which the billowy scarf of the young duchess glowed and like two periwinkle flowers growing beyond reach and blossoming now again her two eyes sunlit with an azure smile and the name guermantes of those days is also like one of those little balloons which have been filled wilh oxygen or some such gas when i come to explode it to make it emit what it contains i breathe the air of the combray of that year of that day mingled with a fragrance of hawthorn blossom blown by the wind from the corner of the square harbinger of rain which now sent the sun packing now let him spread himself over the red woollen carpet to the sacristy steeping it in a bright geranium scarlet with that so to speak wagnerian harmony in its gaiety which makes the wedding service always impressive but even apart from rare moments such as these in which suddenly we feel the original entity quiver and resume its form carve itself out of the syllables now soundless dead if in the giddy rush of daily life in which they serve only the most practical purposes names have lost all their colour like a prismatic top that spins too quickly and seems only grey when on the other hand in our musings we reflect we seek so as to return to the past to slacken to suspend the perpetual motion by which we are borne alcng gradually we see once more appear side by side but entirely distinct from one another the tints which in the course of our existence have been successively presented to us by a single name what form was assumed in my mind by this name guermantes when my first nurse knowing no more probably than i know to day in whose honour it had been composed sang me to sleep with that old ditty gloire la marquise de guermantes or when some years later the veteran mar chal de guermantes making my nursery maid s bosom swell with pride stopped in the champs elys es to remark a fine child that and gave me a chocolate drop from his comfit box i cannot of course now say those years of my earliest childhood are no longer a part of myself they are external to me i can learn nothing of them save as we learn things that happened before we were born from the accounts given me by other people but more recently i find in the period of that name s occupation of me seven or eight different shapes which it has successively assumed the earliest were the most beautiful gradually my musings forced by reality to abandon a position that was no longer tenable established themselves anew in one slightly less advanced until they were obliged to retire still farther and with mme de guermantes was transformed simultaneously her dwelling itself also the offspring of that name fertilised from year to year by some word or other that came to my ears and modulated the tone of my musings that dwelling of hers reflected them in its very stones which had turned to mirrors like the surface of a cloud or of a lake a dungeon keep without mass no more indeed than a band of orange light from the summit of which the lord and his lady dealt out life and death to their vassals had given place right at the end of that guermantes way along which on so many summer afternoons i retraced with my parents the course of the vivonne to that land of bubbling streams where the duchess taught me to fish for trout and to know the names of the flowers whose red and purple clusters adorned the walls of the neighbouring gardens then it had been the ancient heritage famous in song and story from which the proud race of guermantes like a carved and mellow tower that traverses the ages had risen already over france when the sky was still empty at those points where later were to rise notre dame of paris and notre dame of chartres when on the summit of the hill of laon the nave of its cathedral had not yet been poised like the ark of the deluge on the summit of mount ararat crowded with patriarchs and judges anxiously leaning from its windows to see whether the wrath of god were yet appeased carrying with it the types of the vegetation that was to multiply on the earth brimming over with animals which have escaped even by the towers where oxen grazing calmly upon the roof look down over the plains of champagne when the traveller who left beauvais at the close of day did not yet see following him and turning with his road outspread against the gilded screen of the western sky the black ribbed wings of the cathedral it was this guermantes like the scene of a novel an imaginary landscape which i could with difficulty picture to myself and longed all the more to discover set in the midst of real lands and roads which all of a sudden would become alive with heraldic details within a few miles of a railway station i recalled the names of the places round it as if they had been situated at the foot of parnassus or of helicon and they seemed precious to me as the physical conditions in the realm of topographical science required for the production of an unaccountable phenomenon i saw again the escutcheons blazoned beneath the windows of combray church their quarters filled century after century with all the lordships which by marriage or conquest this illustrious house had brought flying to it from all the corners of germany italy and france vast territories in the north strong cities in the south assembled there to group themselves in guermantes and losing their material quality to inscribe allegorically their dungeon vert or castle triple towered argent upon its azure field i had heard of the famous tapestries of guermantes i could see them mediaeval and blue a trifle coarse detach themselves like a floating cloud from the legendary amaranthine name at the foot of the ancient forest in which childebert went so often hunting and this delicate mysterious background of their lands this vista of the ages it seemed to me that as effectively as by journeying to see them i might penetrate all their secrets simply by coming in contact for a moment in paris with mme de guermantes the princess paramount of the place and lady of the lake as if her face her speech must possess the local charm of forest groves and streams and the same secular peculiarities as the old customs recorded in her archives but then i had met saint loup he had told me that the castle had borne the name of guermantes only since the seventeenth century when that family had acquired it they had lived until then in the neighbourhood but their title was not taken from those parts the village of guermantes had received its name from the castle round which it had been built and so that it should not destroy the view from the castle a servitude still in force traced the line of its streets and limited the height of its houses as for the tapestries they were by boucher bought in the nineteenth century by a guermantes with a taste for the arts and hung interspersed with a number of sporting pictures of no merit which he himself had painted in a hideous drawing room upholstered in adrianople and plush by these revelations saint loup had introduced into the castle elements foreign to the name of guermantes which made it impossible for me to continue to extract solely from the resonance of the syllables the stone and mortar of its walls and so in the heart of the name was effaced the castle mirrored in its lake and what now became apparent to me surrounding mme de guermantes as her dwelling had been her house in paris the h tel de guermantes limpid like its name for no material and opaque element intervened to interrupt and blind its transparence as the word church signifies not only the temple but the assembly of the faithful also this h tel de guermantes comprised all those who shared the life of the duchess but these intimates on whom i had never set eyes were for me only famous and poetic names and knowing exclusively persons who themselves also were names only did but enhance and protect the mystery of the duchess by extending all round her a vast halo which at the most declined in brilliance as its circumference increased in the parties which she gave since i could not imagine the guests as having any bodies any moustaches any boots as making any utterances that were commonplace or even original in a human and rational way this whirlpool of names introducing less material substance than would a phantom banquet or a spectral ball round that statuette in dresden china which was madame de guermantes kept for her palace of glass the transparence of a showcase then after saint loup had told me various anecdotes about his cousin s chaplain her gardener and the rest the h tel de guermantes had become as the louvre might have been in days gone by a kind of castle surrounded in the very heart of paris by its own domains acquired by inheritance by virtue of an ancient right that had quaintly survived over which she still enjoyed feudal privileges but this last dwelling itself vanished when we had come to live beside mme de villeparisis in one of the flats adjoining that occupied by mme de guermantes in a wing of the h tel it was one of those old town houses a few of which are perhaps still to be found in which the court of honour whether they were alluvial deposits washed there by the rising tide of democracy or a legacy from a more primitive time when the different trades were clustered round the overlord is flanked by little shops and workrooms a shoemaker s for instance or a tailor s such as we see nestling between the buttresses of those cathedrals which the aesthetic zeal of the restorer has not swept clear of such accretions a porter who also does cobbling keeps hens grows flowers and at the far end in the main building a comtesse who when she drives out in her old carriage and pair flaunting on her hat a few nasturtiums which seem to have escaped from the plot by the porter s lodge with by the coachman s side on the box a footman who gets down to leave cards at every aristocratic mansion in the neighbourhood scatters vague little smiles and waves her hand in greeting to the porter s children and to such of her respectable fellow tenants as may happen to be passing who to her contemptuous affability and levelling pride seem all the same in the house in which we had now come to live the great lady at the end of the courtyard was a duchess smart and still quite young she was in fact mme de guermantes and thanks to fran oise i soon came to know all about her household for the guermantes to whom fran oise regularly alluded as the people below or downstairs were her constant preoccupation from the first thing in the morning when as she did mamma s hair casting a forbidden irresistible furtive glance down into the courtyard she would say look at that now a pair of holy sisters that ll be for downstairs surely or oh just look at the fine pheasants in the kitchen window no need to ask where they came from the duke will have been out with his gun until the last thing at night when if her ear while she was putting out my night things caught a few notes of a song she would conclude they re having company down below gay doings i ll be bound whereupon in her symmetrical face beneath the arch of her now snow white hair a smile from her young days sprightly but proper would for a moment set each of her features in its place arranging them in an intricate and special order as though for a country dance but the moment in the life of the guermantes which excited the keenest interest in fran oise gave her the most complete satisfaction and at the same time the sharpest annoyance was that at which the two halves of the great gate having been thrust apart the duchess stepped into her carriage it was generally a little while after our servants had finished the celebration of that sort of solemn passover which none might disturb called their midday dinner during which they were so far taboo that my father himself was not allowed to ring for them knowing moreover that none of them would have paid any more attention to the fifth peal than to the first and that the discourtesy would therefore have been a pure waste of time and trouble though not without trouble in store for himself for fran oise who in her old age lost no opportunity of standing upon her dignity would without fail have presented him for the rest of the day with a face covered with the tiny red cuneiform hieroglyphs by which she made visible though by no means legible to the outer world the long tale of her griefs and the profound reasons for her dissatisfactions she would enlarge upon them too in a running aside but not so that we could catch her words she called this practice which she imagined must be infuriating mortifying as she herself put it vexing to us saying low masses all the blessed day the last rites accomplished fran oise who was at one and the same time as in the primitive church the celebrant and one of the faithful helped herself to a final glass undid the napkin from her throat folded it after wiping from her lips a stain of watered wine and coffee slipped it into its ring turned a doleful eye to thank her young footman who to shew his zeal in her service was saying come ma am a drop more of the grape it s d licious to day and went straight across to the window which she flung open protesting that it was too hot to breathe in this wretched kitchen dexterously casting as she turned the latch and let in the fresh air a glance of studied indifference into the courtyard below she furtively elicited the conclusion that the duchess was not ready yet to start brooded for a moment with contemptuous impassioned eyes over the waiting carriage and this meed of attention once paid to the things of the earth raised them towards the heavens whose purity she had already divined from the sweetness of the air and the warmth of the sun and let them rest on a corner of the roof at the place where every spring there came and built immediately over the chimney of my bedroom a pair of pigeons like those she used to hear cooing from her kitchen at combray ah combray combray she cried and the almost singing tone in which she declaimed this invocation might taken with the arlesian purity of her features have made the onlooker suspect her of a southern origin and that the lost land which she was lamenting was no more really than a land of adoption if so he would have been wrong for it seems that there is no province that has not its own south country do we not indeed constantly meet savoyards and bretons in whose speech we find all those pleasing transpositions of longs and shorts that are characteristic of the southerner ah combray when shall i look on thee again poor land when shall i pass the blessed day among thy hawthorns under our own poor lily oaks hearing the grasshoppers sing and the vivonne making a little noise like someone whispering instead of that wretched bell from our young master who can never stay still for half an hour on end without having me run the length of that wicked corridor and even then he makes out i don t come quick enough you d need to hear the bell ring before he has pulled it and if you re a minute late away he flies into the most towering rage alas poor combray maybe i shall see thee only in death when they drop me like a stone into the hollow of the tomb and so nevermore shall i smell thy lovely hawthorns so white and all but in the sleep of death i dare say i shall still hear those three peals of the bell which will have driven me to damnation in this world her soliloquy was interrupted by the voice of the waistcoat maker downstairs the same who had so delighted my grandmother once long ago when she had gone to pay a call on mme de villeparisis and now occupied no less exalted a place in franchise s affections having raised his head when he heard our window open he had already been trying for some time to attract his neighbour s attention in order to bid her good day the coquetry of the young girl that fran oise had once been softened and refined for m jupien the querulous face of our old cook dulled by age ill temper and the heat of the kitchen fire and it was with a charming blend of reserve familiarity and modesty that she bestowed a gracious salutation on the waistcoat maker but without making any audible response for if she did infringe mamma s orders by looking into the courtyard she would never have dared to go the length of talking from the window which would have been quite enough according to her to bring down on her a whole chapter from the mistress she pointed to the waiting carriage as who should say a fine pair eh though what she actually muttered was what an old rattle trap but principally because she knew that he would be bound to answer putting his hand to his lips so as to be audible without having to shout you could have one too if you liked as good as they have and better i dare say only you don t care for that sort of thing and franoise after a modest evasive signal of delight the meaning of which was more or less tastes differ you know simplicity s the rule in this house shut the window again in case mamma should come in these you who might have had more horses than the guermantes were ourselves but jupien was right in saying you since except for a few purely personal gratifications such as when she coughed all day long without ceasing and everyone in the house was afraid of catching her cold that of pretending with an irritating little titter that she had not got a cold like those plants that an animal to which they are wholly attached keeps alive with food which it catches eats and digests for them and of which it offers them the ultimate and easily assimilable residue fran oise lived with us in full community it was we who with our virtues our wealth our style of living must take on ourselves the task of concocting those little sops to her vanity out of which was formed with the addition of the recognised rights of freely practising the cult of the midday dinner according to the traditional custom which included a mouthful of air at the window when the meal was finished a certain amount of loitering in the street when she went out to do her marketing and a holiday on sundays when she paid a visit to her niece the portion of happiness indispensable to her existence and so it can be understood that fran oise might well have succumbed in those first days of our migration a victim in a house where my father s claims to distinction were not yet known to a malady which she herself called wearying wearying in the active sense in which the word ennui is employed by corneille or in the last letters of soldiers who end by taking their own lives because they are wearying for their girls or for their native villages fran oise s wearying had soon been cured by none other than jupien for he at once procured her a pleasure no less keen indeed more refined than she would have felt if we had decided to keep a carriage very good class those juliens for fran oise readily assimilated new names to those with which she was already familiar very worthy people you can see it written on their faces jupien was in fact able to understand and to inform the world that if we did not keep a carriage it was because we had no wish for one this new friend of fran oise was very little at home having obtained a post in one of the government offices a waistcoat maker first of all with the chit of a girl whom my grandmother had taken for his daughter he had lost all interest in the exercise of that calling after his assistant who when still little more than a child had shewn great skill in darning a torn skirt that day when my grandmother had gone to call on mme de villeparisis had turned to ladies fashions and become a seamstress a prentice hand to begin with in a dressmaker s workroom set to stitch a seam to fasten a flounce to sew on a button or to press a crease to fix a waistband with hooks and eyes she had quickly risen to be second and then chief assistant and having formed a connexion of her own among ladies of fashion now worked at home that is to say in our courtyard generally with one or two of her young friends from the workroom whom she had taken on as apprentices after this jupien s presence in the place had ceased to matter no doubt the little girl a big girl by this time had often to cut out waistcoats still but with her friends to assist her she needed no one besides and so jupien her uncle had sought employment outside he was free at first to return home at midday then when he had definitely succeeded the man whose substitute only he had begun by being not before dinner time his appointment to the regular establishment was fortunately not announced until some weeks after our arrival so that his courtesy could be brought to bear on her long enough to help fran oise to pass through the first most difficult phase without undue suffering at the same time and without underrating his value to fran oise as so to speak a sedative during the period of transition i am bound to say that my first impression of jupien had been far from favourable at a little distance entirely ruining the effect that his plump cheeks and vivid colouring would otherwise have produced his eyes brimming with a compassionate mournful dreamy gaze led one to suppose that he was seriously ill or had just suffered a great bereavement not only was he nothing of the sort but as soon as he opened his mouth and his speech by the way was perfect he was quite markedly cynical and cold there resulted from this discord between eyes and lips a certain falsity which was not attractive and by which he had himself the air of being made as uncomfortable as a guest who arrives in morning dress at a party where everyone else is in evening dress or as a commoner who having to speak to a royal personage does not know exactly how he ought to address him and gets round the difficulty by cutting down his remarks to almost nothing jupien s here the comparison ends were on the contrary charming indeed corresponding possibly to this overflowing of his face by his eyes which one ceased to notice when one came to know him i soon discerned in him a rare intellect and one of the most spontaneously literary that it has been my privilege to come across in the sense that probably without education he possessed or had assimilated with the help only of a few books skimmed in early life the most ingenious turns of speech the most gifted people that i had known had died young and so i was convinced that jupien s life would soon be cut short kindness was among his qualities and pity the most delicate and the most generous feelings for others but his part in the life of fran oise had soon ceased to be indispensable she had learned to put up with understudies indeed when a tradesman or servant came to our door with a parcel or message while seeming to pay no attention and merely pointing vaguely to an empty chair fran oise so skilfully put to the best advantage the few seconds that he spent in the kitchen while he waited for mamma s answer that it was very seldom that the stranger went away without having ineradicably engraved upon his memory the conviction that if we did not have any particular thing it was because we had no wish for it if she made such a point of other people s knowing that we had money for she knew nothing of what saint loup used to call partitive articles and said simply have money fetch water of their realising that we were rich it was not because riches with nothing else besides riches without virtue were in her eyes the supreme good in life but virtue without riches was not her ideal either riches were for her so to speak a necessary condition of virtue failing which virtue itself would lack both merit and charm she distinguished so little between them that she had come in time to invest each with the other s attributes to expect some material comfort from virtue to discover something edifying in riches as soon as she had shut the window again which she did quickly otherwise mamma would it appeared have heaped on her every conceivable insult fran oise began with many groans and sighs to put straight the kitchen table there are some guermantes who stay in the rue de la chaise began my father s valet i had a friend who used to be with them he was their second coachman and i know a fellow not my old pal but his brother in law who did his time in the army with one of the baron de guermantes s stud grooms does your mother know you re out added the valet who was in the habit just as he used to hum the popular airs of the season of peppering his conversation with all the latest witticisms fran oise with the tired eyes of an ageing woman eyes which moreover saw everything from combray in a hazy distance made out not the witticism that underlay the words but that there must be something witty in them since they bore no relation to the rest of his speech and had been uttered with considerable emphasis by one whom she knew to be a joker she smiled at him therefore with an air of benevolent bewilderment as who should say always the same that victor and she was genuinely pleased knowing that listening to smart sayings of this sort was akin if remotely to those reputable social pleasures for which in every class of society people make

lyricsin which camacho s wedding is continued with other delightful incidents while don quixote and sancho were engaged in the discussion set forth the last chapter they heard loud shouts and a great noise which were uttered and made by the men on the mares as they went at full gallop shouting to receive the bride and bridegroom who were approaching with musical instruments and pageantry of all sorts around them and accompanied by the priest and the relatives of both and all the most distinguished people of the surrounding villages when sancho saw the bride he exclaimed by my faith she is not dressed like a country girl but like some fine court lady egad as well as i can make out the patena she wears rich coral and her green cuenca stuff is thirty pile velvet and then the white linen trimming by my oath but it s satin look at her hands jet rings on them may i never have luck if they re not gold rings and real gold and set with pearls as white as a curdled milk and every one of them worth an eye of one s head whoreson baggage what hair she has if it s not a wig i never saw longer or fairer all the days of my life see how bravely she bears herself and her shape wouldn t you say she was like a walking palm tree loaded with clusters of dates for the trinkets she has hanging from her hair and neck look just like them i swear in my heart she is a brave lass and fit to pass over the banks of flanders don quixote laughed at sancho s boorish eulogies and thought that saving his lady dulcinea del toboso he had never seen a more beautiful woman the fair quiteria appeared somewhat pale which was no doubt because of the bad night brides always pass dressing themselves out for their wedding on the morrow they advanced towards a theatre that stood on one side of the meadow decked with carpets and boughs where they were to plight their troth and from which they were to behold the dances and plays but at the moment of their arrival at the spot they heard a loud outcry behind them and a voice exclaiming wait a little ye as inconsiderate as ye are hasty at these words all turned round and perceived that the speaker was a man clad in what seemed to be a loose black coat garnished with crimson patches like flames he was crowned as was presently seen with a crown of gloomy cypress and in his hand he held a long staff as he approached he was recognised by everyone as the gay basilio and all waited anxiously to see what would come of his words in dread of some catastrophe in consequence of his appearance at such a moment he came up at last weary and breathless and planting himself in front of the bridal pair drove his staff which had a steel spike at the end into the ground and with a pale face and eyes fixed on quiteria he thus addressed her in a hoarse trembling voice well dost thou know ungrateful quiteria that according to the holy law we acknowledge so long as live thou canst take no husband nor art thou ignorant either that in my hopes that time and my own exertions would improve my fortunes i have never failed to observe the respect due to thy honour but thou casting behind thee all thou owest to my true love wouldst surrender what is mine to another whose wealth serves to bring him not only good fortune but supreme happiness and now to complete it not that i think he deserves it but inasmuch as heaven is pleased to bestow it upon him i will with my own hands do away with the obstacle that may interfere with it and remove myself from between you long live the rich camacho many a happy year may he live with the ungrateful quiteria and let the poor basilio die basilio whose poverty clipped the wings of his happiness and brought him to the grave and so saying he seized the staff he had driven into the ground and leaving one half of it fixed there showed it to be a sheath that concealed a tolerably long rapier and what may be called its hilt being planted in the ground he swiftly coolly and deliberately threw himself upon it and in an instant the bloody point and half the steel blade appeared at his back the unhappy man falling to the earth bathed in his blood and transfixed by his own weapon his friends at once ran to his aid filled with grief at his misery and sad fate and don quixote dismounting from rocinante hastened to support him and took him in his arms and found he had not yet ceased to breathe they were about to draw out the rapier but the priest who was standing by objected to its being withdrawn before he had confessed him as the instant of its withdrawal would be that of this death basilio however reviving slightly said in a weak voice as though in pain if thou wouldst consent cruel quiteria to give me thy hand as my bride in this last fatal moment i might still hope that my rashness would find pardon as by its means i attained the bliss of being thine hearing this the priest bade him think of the welfare of his soul rather than of the cravings of the body and in all earnestness implore god s pardon for his sins and for his rash resolve to which basilio replied that he was determined not to confess unless quiteria first gave him her hand in marriage for that happiness would compose his mind and give him courage to make his confession don quixote hearing the wounded man s entreaty exclaimed aloud that what basilio asked was just and reasonable and moreover a request that might be easily complied with and that it would be as much to senor camacho s honour to receive the lady quiteria as the widow of the brave basilio as if he received her direct from her father in this case said he it will be only to say yes and no consequences can follow the utterance of the word for the nuptial couch of this marriage must be the grave camacho was listening to all this perplexed and bewildered and not knowing what to say or do but so urgent were the entreaties of basilio s friends imploring him to allow quiteria to give him her hand so that his soul quitting this life in despair should not be lost that they moved nay forced him to say that if quiteria were willing to give it he was satisfied as it was only putting off the fulfillment of his wishes for a moment at once all assailed quiteria and pressed her some with prayers and others with tears and others with persuasive arguments to give her hand to poor basilio but she harder than marble and more unmoved than any statue seemed unable or unwilling to utter a word nor would she have given any reply had not the priest bade her decide quickly what she meant to do as basilio now had his soul at his teeth and there was no time for hesitation on this the fair quiteria to all appearance distressed grieved and repentant advanced without a word to where basilio lay his eyes already turned in his head his breathing short and painful murmuring the name of quiteria between his teeth and apparently about to die like a heathen and not like a christian quiteria approached him and kneeling demanded his hand by signs without speaking basilio opened his eyes and gazing fixedly at her said o quiteria why hast thou turned compassionate at a moment when thy compassion will serve as a dagger to rob me of life for i have not now the strength left either to bear the happiness thou givest me in accepting me as thine or to suppress the pain that is rapidly drawing the dread shadow of death over my eyes what i entreat of thee o thou fatal star to me is that the hand thou demandest of me and wouldst give me be not given out of complaisance or to deceive me afresh but that thou confess and declare that without any constraint upon thy will thou givest it to me as to thy lawful husband for it is not meet that thou shouldst trifle with me at such a moment as this or have recourse to falsehoods with one who has dealt so truly by thee while uttering these words he showed such weakness that the bystanders expected each return of faintness would take his life with it then quiteria overcome with modesty and shame holding in her right hand the hand of basilio said no force would bend my will as freely therefore as it is possible for me to do so i give thee the hand of a lawful wife and take thine if thou givest it to me of thine own free will untroubled and unaffected by the calamity thy hasty act has brought upon thee yes i give it said basilio not agitated or distracted but with unclouded reason that heaven is pleased to grant me thus do i give myself to be thy husband and i give myself to be thy wife said quiteria whether thou livest many years or they carry thee from my arms to the grave for one so badly wounded observed sancho at this point this young man has a great deal to say they should make him leave off billing and cooing and attend to his soul for to my thinking he has it more on his tongue than at his teeth basilio and quiteria having thus joined hands the priest deeply moved and with tears in his eyes pronounced the blessing upon them and implored heaven to grant an easy passage to the soul of the newly wedded man who the instant he received the blessing started nimbly to his feet and with unparalleled effrontery pulled out the rapier that had been sheathed in his body all the bystanders were astounded and some more simple than inquiring began shouting a miracle a miracle but basilio replied no miracle no miracle only a trick a trick the priest perplexed and amazed made haste to examine the wound with both hands and found that the blade had passed not through basilio s flesh and ribs but through a hollow iron tube full of blood which he had adroitly fixed at the place the blood as was afterwards ascertained having been so prepared as not to congeal in short the priest and camacho and most of those present saw they were tricked and made fools of the bride showed no signs of displeasure at the deception on the contrary hearing them say that the marriage being fraudulent would not be valid she said that she confirmed it afresh whence they all concluded that the affair had been planned by agreement and understanding between the pair whereat camacho and his supporters were so mortified that they proceeded to revenge themselves by violence and a great number of them drawing their swords attacked basilio in whose protection as many more swords were in an instant unsheathed while don quixote taking the lead on horseback with his lance over his arm and well covered with his shield made all give way before him sancho who never found any pleasure or enjoyment in such doings retreated to the wine jars from which he had taken his delectable skimmings considering that as a holy place that spot would be respected hold sirs hold cried don quixote in a loud voice we have no right to take vengeance for wrongs that love may do to us remember love and war are the same thing and as in war it is allowable and common to make use of wiles and stratagems to overcome the enemy so in the contests and rivalries of love the tricks and devices employed to attain the desired end are justifiable provided they be not to the discredit or dishonour of the loved object quiteria belonged to basilio and basilio to quiteria by the just and beneficent disposal of heaven camacho is rich and can purchase his pleasure when where and as it pleases him basilio has but this ewe lamb and no one however powerful he may be shall take her from him these two whom god hath joined man cannot separate and he who attempts it must first pass the point of this lance and so saying he brandished it so stoutly and dexterously that he overawed all who did not know him but so deep an impression had the rejection of quiteria made on camacho s mind that it banished her at once from his thoughts and so the counsels of the priest who was a wise and kindly disposed man prevailed with him and by their means he and his partisans were pacified and tranquillised and to prove it put up their swords again inveighing against the pliancy of quiteria rather than the craftiness of basilio camacho maintaining that if quiteria as a maiden had such a love for basilio she would have loved him too as a married woman and that he ought to thank heaven more for having taken her than for having given her camacho and those of his following therefore being consoled and pacified those on basilio s side were appeased and the rich camacho to show that he felt no resentment for the trick and did not care about it desired the festival to go on just as if he were married in reality neither basilio however nor his bride nor their followers would take any part in it and they withdrew to basilio s village for the poor if they are persons of virtue and good sense have those who follow honour and uphold them just as the rich have those who flatter and dance attendance on them with them they carried don quixote regarding him as a man of worth and a stout one sancho alone had a cloud on his soul for he found himself debarred from waiting for camacho s

there but clips said you the smart type cause your job ain t bullshit if you could pay your bills for pushing a cart right now i got a main problem with you ness it s how you want us battle rappers to be respectable when everybody on bad boy don t got respect for you if biggie was alive that nigga would probably snuff you if black rob seen you that nigga probably cut you lil kim wouldn t give you head faith evans wouldn t touch you come to think of it nigga even jae millz said fuck you so nigga fuck you cause every time i see your battle they fucking trash e ness fuck i hate your fucking face your fucking clothes and your fucking swag e ness fucking fuck your gang fuck your set fuck your flag e ness bullshit outta here fuck your mom fuck your aunt fuck your girl the only person i won t say is fuck your dad that s cause he died but if he was alive he ll be fucking mad seeing a twenty year old kill him makes him fucking mad let them know that you a bitch you a snitch and fucking fag you

me fucking sick look in my eyes when i rhyme you don t got no fucking house and no fucking whip i use fucking in all them other bars to let you know you should fucking quit now that i disposed him who still believe that he king i just took away e heart e hart e ness say the cheesecake line again say the cheesecake line again now he can go battle at queen of the ring round e ness dna stands for the dirtiest nigga alive this is the cleanest you have ever been and i m somewhat surprised now someone tell dna to open up his eyes cause when you taking niggas money that s a whole different high now we d all like to thank charlie clips for taking care of dna i woulda been his father if his mother had the e j well charlie i m truly sorry it had to be this way my llama like a fucking piranha i let it eat away see ya music is trash your mixtapes never sell only way you ll get a deal is if you take one to tell i don t know why the fuck they gave me you i m crazier than crazy glue yeah i ve been skating through since i ve been doing this before the yankees wore navy blue fuck rap you get smacked crowd boos wow y all niggas booing man y all niggas hating listen i m not even gonna finish that let him rap nah nah they fucking my shit up smack tries to calm the crowd down i don t know why the fuck they gave me you i m crazier than crazy glue yeah i ve been skating through since i ve been doing this before the yankees wore navy blue and fuck rap you get smrrracked look at what you made me do and you getting lazy too i seen ya last battle if that tech ain t jam in that third round my man woulda had you i say that to say this niggas like you i can t bang with why cause you only as tough as them niggas you hang with and y all gon hate when i say this when i say mook ain t the greatest cause mook ain t been talked about since math gave him a facelift word is math hoffa ain t no gat popper crowd boos i guess you held ya own but then you really did some faggot shit to kill see rone for rone bar for bar woulda beat you probably but what type of nigga you know tape a fake bomb to his body he ripped off his hoodie no t shirt no tanktop your whole career s been built off the glass you re a bankshop now let me tell you some more faggot shit when you battle big titus i mma expose this litte nigga for the people that didn t see it some super duper gay shit man i just couldn t believe it cause the first half of that second round was talking about that man penis now i mma tell you some more shit i found out about this nigga when i was coming up the highway this bum ass nigga tried to take charli baltimore out on a date to tgi friday now you need to beg one of the labels to give you some money and stop trying to treat these hoes to a for this faggot just cut his dick off and sit next rick ross wear a bunch of lip gloss go and get his shit tossed this fight was fixed don t you feel like you ripped off scrolling through them call logs looking through them miss calls ask ya man should you battle ness he told you nig nah i fuck with you and everything but i m not going with y all fucking with him you done ran into a brick wall pitfall chris paul when he get his shit off these diamonds are forever say something clever cause nobody what you say i m gon translate it better and that bullshit move you threw on youtube was the dumbest shit i seen in my life to get views now go ahead let him have it let him have it round dna e ness round one and two i already show y all who s the better rapper but this the part where we analyze your career like a book and go through every chapter see i done mentioned cheesecake making the band and p diddy cause y all would say it s predictable and call it wack but ask yourself this what else has e ness done to put his career on the map so instead of saying i m being predictable tell this man he hasn t progressed i bet you never thought of that cause if in ten years you only known for three things now whose fault is this see this battle rap world started off as a network and over time it became community so to see someone make it we should all be happy and spread the unity but i m angry at what you could ve been and for that you a fool to me cause every battle rapper wouldve died for that opportunity so as a man as a father as a artist you are useless you don t blog do videos or put out any music so how could you get mad if we mention cheese cake making a band p diddy or you getting fucking shelved when you had several opportunities in your career to do something else that s why the stuff i m telling you right now is some of the realest shit there s a hundred dudes that should be in your spot cause they was really out killing shit iron solomon and mysonne joked about that cheese cake nigga i m dead serious they started something but with this scheme right here i mma finish it i ll bet everybody you know gave you a pound when you made it on that show cause they thought you was all great little did they know you were cause after biggie died diddy had lost faith thought ya music was bananas but you realized it wasn t by your fourth tape so he shelved you on your birthday and you went into depression and started pitching that raw base but have to provide for your kids so you traded in them karats started gaining more weight do anything to make sure they get food all month and make sure they all safe now y all don t need a pineapple to see his life s upside down and in the wrong place so going to juniors made sense cause in the end all diddy ever gave you was short cake now i want no applause for that so don t start shaking my hand that was just chapter one chapter two is making the band when diddy first started fucking with you he liked for your aggressiveness and your passion so much to the point that out of everyone on that show he made you the captain thought you would have a bright future thought would move in the world far so how the fuck did you let chopper become more popular than you on world star e ness fuck outta here you don t do no shows don t put out no mixtapes you ain t seeing bling and babs is more popular than you in battle rap off of hosting queen of the ring now mysonne and iron solomon joked about the band but nigga i m dead serious they started something but with this scheme right here i mma finish it you see your career is like the internet it started off at a high speed and you became the man quick but made a lot of bad connections so all of puff s plans switched lost every industry friend nobody to dial up and all of ya fans dipped and now got the lowest buzz online out of anyone you was in that band with bandwidth but i don t want no cheers for that so don t start making mad noise cause that was chapter two chapter three is bad boy now clearly puff don t fuck with you or you don t know math boy cause that chain you got says b that lets me know you don t know how to add boy e ness it s a l nigga loch ness loch ness get it b add boy that equals bad boy for the fact your chain doesn t say that that lets me know you doing bad boy did i speed it up too fast am i going too fast boy looks like puff and no one on that label fuck with you on bad boy you should palm smacked til you fall cause out of everybody you got the worse contract of them all if they woulda gave that to black rob he woulda say whoa whoa whoa whoa g dep woulda asked for a special delivery and been gone mase woulda hopped on his horse and carriage as soon as that bread s gone would say it s over now faith evans was too head strong biggie looked you dead in the eye and told you you dead wrong now in conclusion to my third round as y all see i killed him e ness is deceased now finally this young man can start resting in peace it s round three it s getting hot in here and off the career choices you made you got yourself the fuck outta here embed,"['rex', 'forever', 'trust', 'dog', 'drop', 'laugh', 'fan', 'banana', 'spend', 'wig', 'whip', 'mile',

are nimble and light you can get there by candlelight it is easy to see the beginnings of things and harder to see the ends i can remember now with a clarity that makes the nerves in the back of my neck constrict when new york began for me but i cannot lay my finger upon the moment it ended can never cut through the ambiguities and second starts and broken resolves to the exact place on the page where the heroine is no longer as optimistic as she once was when i first saw new york i was twenty and it was summertime and i got off a dc at the old idlewild temporary terminal in a new dress which had seemed very smart in sacramento but seemed less smart already even in the old idlewild temporary terminal and the warm air smelled of mildew and some instinct programmed by all the movies i had ever seen and all the songs i had ever read about new york informed me that it would never be quite the same again in fact it never was some time later there was a song in the jukeboxes on the upper east side that went but where is the schoolgirl who used to be me and if it was late enough at night i used to wonder that i know now that almost everyone wonders something like that sooner or later and no matter what he or she is doing but one of the mixed blessings of being twenty and twenty one and even twenty three is the conviction that nothing like this all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding has ever happened to anyone before of course it might have been some other city had circumstances been different and the time been different and had i been different might have been paris or chicago or even san francisco but because i am talking about myself i am talking here about new york that first night i opened my window on the bus into town and watched for the skyline but all i could see were the wastes of queens and big signs that said midtown tunnel this lane and then a flood of summer rain even that seemed remarkable and exotic for i had come out of the west where there was no summer rain and for the next three days i sat wrapped in blankets in a hotel room air conditioned to degrees and tried to get over a cold and a high fever it did not occur to me to call a doctor because i knew none and although it did occur to me to call the desk and ask that the air conditioner be turned off i never called because i did not know how much to tip whoever might come was anyone ever so young i am here to tell you that someone was all i could do during those years was talk long distance to the boy i already knew i would never marry in the spring i would stay in new york i told him just six months and i could see the brooklyn bridge from my window as it turned out the bridge was the triborough and i stayed eight years in retrospect it seems to me that those days before i knew the names of all the bridges were happier than the ones that came later but perhaps you will see that as we go along part of what i want to tell you is what it is like to be young in new york how six months can become eight years with the deceptive ease of a film dissolve for that is how those years appear to me now in a long sequence of sentimental dissolves and old fashioned trick shots the seagram building fountains dissolve into snowflakes i enter a revolving door at twenty and come out a good deal older and on a different street but most particularly i want to explain to you and in the process perhaps to myself why i no longer live in new york it is often said that new york is a city for only the very rich and the very poor it is less often said that new york is also at least for those of us who came there from somewhere else a city only for the very young i remember once one cold bright december evening in new york suggesting a friend who complained of having been around too long that he come with me to a party where there would be i assured him with the bright resourcefulness of twenty three new faces he laughed literally until he choked and i had to roll down the taxi window and hit him on the back new faces he said finally don t tell me about new faces it seemed that the last time he had gone to a party where he had been promised new faces there had been fifteen people in the room and he had already spelt with five of the women and owed money to all but two of the men i laughed with him but the first snow had just begun to fall and the big christmas trees glittered yellow and white as far as i could see up park avenue and i had a new dress and it would be a long while before i would come to understand the particular moral of the story it would be a long while because quite simply i was in love with new york i do not mean love in any colloquial way i mean that i was in love with the city the way you love the first person who ever touches you and you never love anyone quite that way again i remember walking across sixty second street one twilight that first spring or the second spring they were all alike for a while i was late to meet someone but i stopped at lexington avenue and bought a peach and stood on the corner eating it and knew that i had come out out of the west and reached the mirage i could taste the peach and feel the soft air blowing from a subway grating on my legs and i could smell lilac and garbage and expensive perfume and i knew that it would cost something sooner or later because i did not belong there did not come from there but when you are twenty two or twenty three you figure that later you will have a high emotional balance and be able to pay whatever it costs i still believed in possibilities then still had the sense so peculiar to new york that something extraordinary would happen any minute any day any month i was making only or then a week then put yourself in hattie carnegie s hands i was advised without the slightest trace of irony by an editor of the magazine for which i worked so little money that some weeks i had to charge food at bloomingdale s gourmet shop in order to eat a fact which went unmentioned in the letters i wrote to california i never told my father that i needed money because then he would have sent it and i would never know if i could do it by myself at that time making a living seemed a game to me with arbitrary but quite inflexible rules and except on a certain kind of winter evening six thirty in the seventies say already dark and bitter with a wind off the river when i would be walking very fast toward a bus and would look in the bright windows of brownstones and see cooks working in clean kitchens and and imagine women lighting candles on the floor above and beautiful children being bathed on the floor above that except on nights like those i never felt poor i had the feeling that if i needed money i could always get it i could write a syndicated column for teenagers under the name debbi lynn or i could smuggle gold into india or i could become a call girl and none of would matter nothing was irrevocable everything was within reach just around every corner lay something curious and interesting something i had never before seen or done or known about i could go to a party and meet someone who called himself mr emotional appeal and ran the emotional appeal institute or tina onassis blandford or a florida cracker who was then a regular on what the called the big c the southampton el morocco circuit i m well connected on the big c honey he would tell me over collard greens on his vast borrowed terrace or the widow of the celery king of the harlem market or a piano salesman from bonne terre missouri or someone who had already made and list two fortunes in midland texas i could make promises to myself and to other people and there would be all the time in the world to keep them i could stay up all night and make mistakes and none of them would count you see i was in a curious position in new york it never occurred to me that i was living a real life there in my imagination i was always there for just another few months just until christmas or easter or the first warm day in may for that reason i was most comfortable with the company of southerners they seemed to be in new york as i was on some indefinitely extended leave from wherever they belonged disciplined to consider the future temporary exiles who always knew when the flights left for new orleans or memphis or richmond or in my case california someone who lives with a plane schedule in the drawer lives on a slightly different calendar christmas for example was a difficult season other people could take it in stride going to stowe or going abroad or going for the day to their mothers places in connecticut those of us who believed that we lived somewhere else would spend it making and canceling airline reservations waiting for weatherbound flights as if for the last plane out of lisbon in and finally comforting one another those of us who were left with oranges and mementos and smoked oyster stuffings of childhood gathering close colonials in a far country which is precisely what we were i am not sure that it is possible for anyone brought up in the east to appreciate entirely what new york the idea of new york means to those of us who came out of the west and the south to an eastern child particularly a child who has always has an uncle on wall street and who has spent several hundred saturdays first at f a o schwarz and being fitted for shoes at best s and then waiting under the biltmore clock and dancing to lester lanin new york is just a city albeit the city a plausible place for people to live but to those of us who came from places where no one had heard of lester lanin and grand central station was a saturday radio program where wall street and fifth avenue and madison avenue were not places at all but abstractions money and high fashion and the hucksters new york was no mere city it was instead an infinitely romantic notion the mysterious nexus of all love and money and power the shining and perishable dream itself to think of living there was to reduce the miraculous to the mundane one does not live at xanadu in fact it was difficult in the extreme for me to understand those young women for whom new york was not simply an ephemeral estoril but a real place girls who bought toasters and installed new cabinets in their apartments and committed themselves to some reasonable furniture i never bought any furniture in new york for a year or so i lived in other people s apartments after that i lived in the nineties in an apartment furnished entirely with things taken from storage by a friend whose wife had moved away and when i left the apartment in the nineties that was when i was leaving everything when it was all breaking up i left everything in it even my winter clothes and the map of sacramento county i had hung on the bedroom wall to remind me who i was and i moved into a monastic four room floor through on seventy fifth street monastic is perhaps misleading here implying some chic severity until after i was married and my husband moved some furniture in there was nothing at all in those four rooms except a cheap double mattress and box springs ordered by telephone the day i decided to move and two french garden chairs lent me by a friend who imported them it strikes me now that the people i knew in new york all had curious and self defeating sidelines they imported garden chairs which did not sell very well at hammacher schlemmer or they tried to market hair staighteners in harlem or they ghosted expos s of murder incorporated for sunday supplements i think that perhaps none of us was very serious engag only about our most private lives all i ever did to that apartment was hang fifty yards of yellow theatrical silk across the bedroom windows because i had some idea that the gold light would make me feel better but i did not bother to weight the curtains correctly and all that summer the long panels of transparent golden silk would blow out the windows and get tangled and drenched in afternoon thunderstorms that was the year my twenty eight when i was discovering that not all of the promises would be kept that some things are in fact irrevocable and that it had counted after all every evasion and ever procrastination every word all of it that is what it was all about wasn t it promises now when new york comes back to me it comes in hallucinatory flashes so clinically detailed that i sometimes wish that memory would effect the distortion with which it is commonly credited for a lot of the time i was in new york i used a perfume called fleurs de rocaille and then l air du temps and now the slightest trace of either can short circuit my connections for the rest of the day nor can i smell henri bendel jasmine soap without falling back into the past or the particular mixture of spices used for boiling crabs there were barrels of crab boil in a czech place in the eighties where i once shopped smells of course are notorious memory stimuli but there are other things which affect me the same way blue and white striped sheets vermouth cassis some faded nightgowns which were new in or and some chiffon scarves i bought about the same time i suppose that a lot of us who have been very young in new york have the same scenes in our home screens i remember sitting in a lot of apartments with a slight headache about five o clock in the morning i had a friend who could not sleep and he knew a few other people who had the same trouble and we would watch the sky lighten and have a last drink with no ice and then go home in the early morning when the streets were clean and wet had it rained in the night we never knew and the few cruising taxis still had their headlights on and the only color was the red and green of traffic signals the white rose bars opened very early in the morning i recall waiting in one of them to watch an astronaut go into space waiting so long that at the moment it actually happened i had my eyes not on the television screen but on a cockroach on the tile floor i liked the bleak branches above washington square at dawn and the monochromatic flatness of second avenue the fire escapes and the grilled storefronts peculiar and empty in their perspective it is relatively hard to fight at six thirty or seven in the morning without any sleep which was perhaps one reason why we stayed up all night and it seemed to me a pleasant time of day the windows were shuttered in that apartment in the nineties and i could sleep for a few hours and then go to work i could work the on two or three hours sleep and a container of coffee from chock full o nuts i liked going to work liked the soothing and satisfactory rhythm of getting out a magazine liked the orderly progression of four color closings and two color closings and black and white closings and then the product no abstraction but something which looked effortlessly glossy and could be picked up on a newsstand and weighed in the hand i liked all the minutiae of proofs and layouts liked working late on the nights the magazines went to press sitting and reading variety and waiting for the copy desk to call from my office i could look across town to the weather signal on the mutual of new york building and the lights that alternately spelled time and life above rockeffeler plaza that pleased me obscurely and so did walking uptown in the mauve eight o clocks of early summer evenings and looking at things lowestoft tureens in fifty seventh street windows people in evening clothes trying to get taxis the trees just coming into full leaf the lambent air all the sweet promises of money and summer some years passed but i still did not lose that sense of wonder about new york i began to cherish the loneliness of it the sense that at any given time no one need know where i was or what i was doing i liked walking from the east river over to the hudson and back on brisk days down around the village on warm days a friend would leave me the key to her apartment in the west village when she was out of town and sometimes i would just move down there because by that time the telephone was beginning to bother me the canker you see was already in the rose and not many people had that number i remember one day when someone who did have the west village number came to pick me up for lunch there and we both had hangovers and i cut my finger opening him a beer and burst into tears and we walked to a spanish restaurant and drank bloody marys and gazpacho until we felt better i was not then guilt ridden about spending afternoons that way because i still had all the afternoons in the world and even that late in the game i still liked going to parties all parties bad parties saturday afternoon parties given by recently married couples who lived in stuyvesant town west side parties given by unpublished or failed writers who served cheap red wine and talked about going to guatalajara village parties where all the guests worked for advertising agencies and voted for reform democrats press parties at sardi s the worst kind of parties you will have perceived by now that i was not one to profit by the experience of others that it was a very long time indeed before i stopped believing in new faces and began to understand the lesson in that story which was that it is distinctly possible to stay too long at the fair i could not tell you when i began to understand that all i know is that it was very bad when i was twenty eight everything that was said to me i seemed to have heard before and i could no longer listen i could no longer sit in little bars near grand central and listen to someone complaining of his wife s inability to cope with the help while he missed another train to connecticut i no longer had any interest in hearing about the advances other people had received from their publishers about plays which were having second act trouble in philadelphia or about people i would like very much if only i would come out and meet them i had already met them always there were certain parts of the city which i had to avoid i could not bear upper madison avenue on weekday mornings this was a particularly inconvenient aversion since i then lived just fifty or sixty feet east of madison because i would see women walking yorkshire terriers and shopping at gristede s and some veblenesque gorge would rise in my throat i could not go to times square in the afternoon or to the new york public library for any reason whatsoever one day i could not go into a schrafft s the next it would be the bonwit teller i hurt the people i cared about and insulted those i did not i cut myself off from the one person who was closer to me than any other i cried until i was not even aware when i was crying and when i was not i cried in elevators and in taxis and in chinese laundries and when i went to the doctor he said only that i seemed to be depressed and that i should see a specialist he wrote down a psychiatrist s name and address for me but i did not go instead i got married which as it turned out was a very good thing to do but badly timed since i still could not walk on upper madison avenue in the mornings and still could not talk to people and still cried in chinese laundries i had never before understood what despair meant and i am not sure that i understand now but i understood that year of course i could not work i could not even get dinner with any degree of certainty and i would sit in the apartment on seventy fifth street paralyzed until my husband would call from his office and say gently that i did not have to get dinner that i could meet him at michael s pub or at toots shor s or at sardi s east and then one morning in april we had been married in january he called and told me that he wanted to get out of new york for a while that he would take a six month leave of absence that we would go somewhere it was three years ago he told me that and we have lived in los angeles since many of the people we knew in new york think this a curious aberration and in fact tell us so there is no possible no adequate answer to that and so we give certain stock answers the answers everyone gives i talk about how difficult it would be for us to afford to live in new york right now about how much space we need all i mean is that i was very young in new york and that at some point the golden rhythm was broken and i am not that young anymore the last time i was in new york was in a cold january and everyone was ill and tired many of the people i used to know there had moved to dallas or had gone on antabuse or had bought a farm in new hampshire we stayed ten days and then we took an afternoon flight back to los angeles and on the way home from the airport that night i could see the moon on the pacific and smell jasmine all around and we both knew that there was no longer any point in keeping the apartment we still kept in new york there were years when i called los angeles the coast but they seem a long time ago embed,"['page', 'san', 'piano', 'laugh', 'south', 'severity',

scene i lyricsact i scene one the younger living room would be a comfortable and well ordered room if it were not for a number of indestructible contradictions to this state of being its furnishings are typical and undistinguished and their primary feature now is that they have clearly had to accommodate the living of too many people for too many years and they are tired still we can see that at some time a time probably no longer remembered by the family except perhaps for mama the furnishings of this room were actually selected with care and love and even hope and brought to this apartment and arranged with taste and pride that was a long time ago now the once loved pattern of the couch upholstery has to fight to show itself from under acres of crocheted doilies and couch covers which have themselves finally come to be more important than the upholstery and here a table or a chair has been moved to disguise the worn places in the carpet but the carpet has fought back by showing its weariness with depressing uniformity elsewhere on its surface weariness has in fact won in this room everything has been polished washed sat on used scrubbed too often all pretenses but living itself have long since vanished from the very atmosphere of this room moreover a section of this room for it is not really a room unto itself though the landlord s lease would make it seem so slopes backward to provide a small kitchen area where the family prepares the meals that are eaten in the living room proper which must also serve as dining room the single window that has been provided for these two rooms is located in this kitchen area the sole natural light the family may enjoy in the course of a day is only that which fights its way through this little window at left a door leads to a bedroom which is shared by mama and her daughter beneatha at right opposite is a second room which in the beginning of the life of this apartment was probably a breakfast room which serves as a bedroom for walter and his wife ruth time sometime between world war ii and the present place chicago s southside at rise it is morning dark in the living room travis is asleep on the make down bed at center an alarm clock sounds from within the bedroom at right and presently ruth enters from that room and closes the door behind her she crosses sleepily toward the window as she passes her sleeping son she reaches down and shakes him a little at the window she raises the shade and a dusky southside morning light comes in feebly she fills a pot with water and puts it on to boil she calls to the boy between yawns in a slightly muffled voice ruth is about thirty we can see that she was a pretty girl even exceptionally so but now it is apparent that life has been little that she expected and disappointment has already begun to hang in her face in a few years before thirty five even she will be known among her people as a settled woman she crosses to her son and gives him a good final rousing shake ruth come on now boy it s seven thirty her son sits up at last in a stupor of sleepiness i say hurry up travis you ain t the only person in the world got to use a bathroom the child a sturdy handsome little boy of ten or eleven drags himself out of the bed and almost blindly takes his towels and today s clothes from drawers and a closet and goes out to the bathroom which is in an outside hall and which is shared by another family or families on the same floor ruth crosses to the bedroom door at right and opens it and calls in to her husband walter lee it s after seven thirty lemme see you do some waking up in there now she waits you better get up from there man it s after seven thirty i tell you she waits again all right you just go ahead and lay there and next thing you know travis be finished and mr johnson ll be in there and you ll be fussing and cussing round here like a madman and be late too she waits at the end of patience walter lee it s time for you to get up she waits another second and then starts to go into the bedroom but is apparently satisfied that her husband has begun to get up she stops pulls the door to and returns to the kitchen area she wipes her face with a moist cloth and runs her fingers through her sleep disheveled hair in a vain effort and ties an apron around her housecoat the bedroom door at right opens and her husband stands in the doorway in his pajamas which are rumpled and mismated he is a lean intense young man in his middle thirties inclined to quick nervous movements and erratic speech habits and always in his voice there is a quality of indictment walter is he out yet ruth what you mean out he ain t hardly got in there good yet walter wandering in still more oriented to sleep than to a new day well what was you doing all that yelling for if i can t even get in there yet stopping and thinking check coming today ruth they said saturday and this is just friday and i hopes to god you ain t going to get up here first thing this morning and start talking to me bout no money cause i bout don t want to hear it walter something the matter with you this morning ruth no i m just sleepy as the devil what kind of eggs you want walter not scrambled ruth starts to scramble eggs paper come ruth points impatiently to the rolled up tribune on the table and he gets it and spreads it out and vaguely reads the front page set off another bomb yesterday ruth maximum indifference did they walter looking up what s the matter with you ruth ain t nothing the matter with me and don t keep asking me that this morning walter ain t nobody bothering you reading the news of the day absently again say colonel mccormick is sick ruth affecting tea party interest is he now poor thing walter sighing and looking at his watch oh me he waits now what is that boy doing in that bathroom all this time he just going to have to start getting up earlier i can t be being late to work on account of him fooling around in there ruth turning on him oh no he ain t going to be getting up no earlier no such thing it ain t his fault that he can t get to bed no earlier nights cause he got a bunch of crazy good for nothing clowns sitting up running their mouths in what is supposed to be his bedroom after ten o clock at night walter that s what you mad about ain t it the things i want to talk about with my friends just couldn t be important in your mind could they he rises and finds a cigarette in her handbag on the table and crosses to the little window and looks out smoking and deeply enjoying this first one ruth almost matter of factly a complaint too automatic to deserve emphasis why you always got to smoke before you eat in the morning walter at the window just look at em down there running and racing to work he turns and faces his wife and watches her a moment at the stove and then suddenly you look young this morning baby ruth indifferently yeah walter just for a second stirring them eggs just for a second it was you looked real young again he reaches for her she crosses away then drily it s gone now you look like yourself again ruth man if you don t shut up and leave me alone walter looking out to the street again first thing a man ought to learn in life is not to make love to no colored woman first thing in the morning you all some eeeevil people at eight o clock in the morning travis appears in the hall doorway almost fully dressed and quite wide awake now his towels and pajamas across his shoulders he opens the door and signals for his father to make the bathroom in a hurry travis watching the bathroom daddy come on walter gets his bathroom utensils and flies out to the bathroom ruth sit down and have your breakfast travis travis mama this is friday gleefully check coming tomorrow huh ruth you get your mind off money and eat your breakfast travis eating this is the morning we supposed to bring the fifty cents to school ruth well i ain t got no fifty cents this morning travis teacher say we have to ruth i don t care what teacher say i ain t got it eat your breakfast travis travis i am eating ruth hush up now and just eat the boy gives her an exasperated look for her lack of understanding and eats grudgingly travis you think grandmama would have it ruth no and i want you to stop asking your grandmother for money you hear me travis outraged gaaaleee i don t ask her she just gimme it sometimes ruth travis willard younger i got too much on me this morning to be travis maybe daddy ruth travis the boy hushes abruptly they are both quiet and tense for several seconds travis presently could i maybe go carry some groceries in front of the supermarket for a little while after school then ruth just hush i said travis jabs his spoon into his cereal bowl viciously and rests his head in anger upon his fists if you through eating you can get over there and make up your bed the boy obeys stiffly and crosses the room almost mechanically to the bed and more or less folds the bedding into a heap then angrily gets his books and cap travis sulking and standing apart from her unnaturally i m gone ruth looking up from the stove to inspect him automatically come here he crosses to her and she studies his head if you don t take this comb and fix this here head you better travis puts down his books with a great sigh of oppression and crosses to the mirror his mother mutters under her breath about his slubbornness bout to march out of here with that head looking just like chickens slept in it i just don t know where you get your slubborn ways and get your jacket too looks chilly out this morning travis with conspicuously brushed hair and jacket i m gone ruth get carfare and milk money waving one finger and not a single penny for no caps you hear me travis with sullen politeness yes m he turns in outrage to leave his mother watches after him as in his frustration he approaches the door almost comically when she speaks to him her voice has become a very gentle tease ruth mocking as she thinks he would say it oh mama makes me so mad sometimes i don t know what to do she waits and continues to his back as he stands stock still in front of the door i wouldn t kiss that woman good bye for nothing in this world this morning the boy finally turns around and rolls his eyes at her knowing the mood has changed and he is vindicated he does not however move toward her yet not for nothing in this world she finally laughs aloud at him and holds out her arms to him and we see that it is a way between them very old and practiced he crosses to her and allows her to embrace him warmly but keeps his face fixed with masculine rigidity she holds him back from her presently and looks at him and runs her fingers over the features of his face with utter gentleness now whose little old angry man are you travis the masculinity and gruffness start to fade at last aw gaalee mama ruth mimicking aw gaaaaalleeeee mama she pushes him with rough playfulness and finality toward the door get on out of here or you going to be late travis in the face of love new aggressiveness mama could i please go carry groceries ruth honey it s starting to get so cold evenings walter coming in from the bathroom and drawing a make believe gun from a make believe holster and shooting at his son what is it he wants to do ruth go carry groceries after school at the supermarket walter well let him go travis quickly to the ally i have to she won t gimme the fifty cents walter to his wife only why not ruth simply and with flavor cause we don t have it walter to ruth only what you tell the boy things like that for reaching down into his pants with a rather important gesture here son he hands the boy the coin but his eyes are directed to his wife s travis takes the money happily travis thanks daddy he starts out ruth watches both of them with murder in her eyes walter stands and stares back at her with defiance and suddenly reaches into his pocket again on an afterthought walter without even looking at his son still staring hard at his wife in fact here s another fifty cents buy yourself some fruit today or take a taxicab to school or something travis whoopee he leaps up and clasps his father around the middle with his legs and they face each other in mutual appreciation slowly walter lee peeks around the boy to catch the violent rays from his wife s eyes and draws his head back as if shot walter you better get down now and get to school man travis at the door o k good bye he exits walter after him pointing with pride that s my boy she looks at him in disgust and turns back to her work you know what i was thinking bout in the bathroom this morning ruth no walter how come you always try to be so pleasant ruth what is there to be pleasant bout walter you want to know what i was thinking bout in the bathroom or not ruth i know what you thinking bout walter ignoring her bout what me and willy harris was talking about last night ruth immediately a refrain willy harris is a good for nothing loudmouth walter anybody who talks to me has got to be a good for nothing loudmouth ain t he and what you know about who is just a good for nothing loudmouth charlie atkins was just a good for nothing loudmouth too wasn t he when he wanted me to go in the dry cleaning business with him and now he s grossing a hundred thousand a year a hundred thousand dollars a year you still call him a loudmouth ruth bitterly oh walter lee she folds her head on her arms over the table walter rising and coming to her and standing over her you tired ain t you tired of everything me the boy the way we live this beat up hole everything ain t you she doesn t look up doesn t answer so tired moaning and groaning all the time but you wouldn t do nothing to help would you you couldn t be on my side that long for nothing could you ruth walter please leave me alone walter a man needs for a woman to back him up ruth walter walter mama would listen to you you know she listen to you more than she do me and bennie she think more of you all you have to do is just sit down with her when you drinking your coffee one morning and talking bout things like you do and he sits down beside her and demonstrates graphically what he thinks her methods and tone should be you just sip your coffee see and say easy like that you been thinking bout that deal walter lee is so interested in bout the store and all and sip some more coffee like what you saying ain t really that important to you and the next thing you know she be listening good and asking you questions and when i come home i can tell her the details this ain t no fly by night proposition baby i mean we figured it out me and willy and bobo ruth with a frown bobo walter yeah you see this little liquor store we got in mind cost seventy five thousand and we figured the initial investment on the place be bout thirty thousand see that be ten thousand each course there s a couple of hundred you got to pay so s you don t spend your life just waiting for them clowns to let your license get approved ruth you mean graft walter frowning impatiently don t call it that see there that just goes to show you what women understand about the world baby don t nothing happen for you in this world less you pay somebody off ruth walter leave me alone she raises her head and stares at him vigorously then says more quietly eat your eggs they gonna be cold walter straightening up from her and looking off that s it there you are man say to his woman i got me a dream his woman say eat your eggs sadly but gaining in power man say i got to take hold of this here world baby and a woman will say eat your eggs and go to work passionately now man say i got to change my life i m choking to death baby and his woman say in utter anguish as he brings his fists down on his thighs your eggs is getting cold ruth softly walter that ain t none of our money walter not listening at all or even looking at her this morning i was lookin in the mirror and thinking about it i m thirty five years old i been married eleven years and i got a boy who sleeps in the living room very very quietly and all i got to give him is stories about how rich white people live ruth eat your eggs walter walter slams the table and jumps up damn my eggs damn all the eggs that ever was ruth then go to work walter looking up at her see i m trying to talk to you bout myself shaking his head with the repetition and all you can say is eat them eggs and go to work ruth wearily honey you never say nothing new i listen to you every day every night and every morning and you never say nothing new shrugging so you would rather be mr arnold than be his chauffeur so i would rather be living in buckingham palace walter that is just what is wrong with the colored woman in this world don t understand about building their men up and making em feel like they somebody like they can do something ruth drily but to hurt there are colored men who do things walter no thanks to the colored woman ruth well being a colored woman i guess i can t help myself none she rises and gets the ironing board and sets it up and attacks a huge pile of rough dried clothes sprinkling them in preparation for the ironing and then rolling them into tight fat balls walter mumbling we one group of men tied to a race of women with small minds his sister beneatha enters she is about twenty as slim and intense as her brother she is not as pretty as her sister in law but her lean almost intellectual face has a handsomeness of its own she wears a bright red flannel nightie and her thick hair stands wildly about her head her speech is a mixture of many things it is different from the rest of the family s insofar as education has permeated her sense of english and perhaps the midwest rather than the south has finally at last won out in her inflection but not altogether because over all of it is a soft slurring and transformed use of vowels which is the decided influence of the southside she passes through the room without looking at either ruth or walter and goes to the outside door and looks a little blindly out to the bathroom she sees that it has been lost to the johnsons she closes the door with a sleepy vengeance and crosses to the table and sits down a little defeated beneatha i am going to start timing those people walter you should get up earlier beneatha her face in her hands she is still fighting the urge to go back to bed really would you suggest dawn where s the paper walter pushing the paper across the table to her as he studies her almost clinically as though he has never seen her before you a horrible looking chick at this hour beneatha drily good morning everybody walter senselessly how is school coming beneatha in the same spirit lovely lovely and you know biology is the greatest looking up at him i dissected something that looked just like you yesterday walter i just wondered if you ve made up your mind and everything beneatha gaining in sharpness and impatience and what did i answer yesterday morning and the day before that ruth from the ironing board like someone disinterested and old don t be so nasty bennie beneatha still to her brother and the day before that and the day before that walter defensively i m interested in you something wrong with that ain t many girls who decide walter and beneatha in unison to be a doctor silence walter have we figured out yet just exactly how much medical school is going to cost ruth walter lee why don t you leave that girl alone and get out of here to work beneatha exits to the bathroom and bangs on the door come on out of there please she comes back into the room walter looking at his sister intently you know the check is coming tomorrow beneatha turning on him with a sharpness all her own that money belongs to mama walter and it s for her to decide how she wants to use it i don t care if she wants to buy a house or a rocket ship or just nail it up somewhere and look at it it s hers not ours hers walter bitterly now ain t that fine you just got your mother s interest at heart ain t you girl you such a nice girl but if mama got that money she can always take a few thousand and help you through school too can t she beneatha i have never asked anyone around here to do anything for me walter no and the line between asking and just accepting when the time comes is big and wide ain t it beneatha with fury what do you want from me brother that i quit school or just drop dead which walter i don t want nothing but for you to stop acting holy round here me and ruth done made some sacrifices for you why can t you do something for the family ruth walter don t be dragging me in it walter you are in it don t you get up and go work in somebody s kitchen for the last three years to help put clothes on her back ruth oh walter that s not fair walter it ain t that nobody expects you to get on your knees and say thank you brother thank you ruth thank you mama and thank you travis for wearing the same pair of shoes for two semesters beneatha dropping to her knees well i do all right thank everybody and forgive me for ever wanting to be anything at all pursuing him on her knees across the floor forgive me forgive me forgive me ruth please stop it your mama ll hear you walter who the hell told you you had to be a doctor if you so crazy bout messing round with sick people then go be a nurse like other women or just get married and be quiet beneatha well you finally got it said it took you three years but you finally got it said walter give up leave me alone it s mama s money walter he was my father too beneatha so what he was mine too and travis grandfather but the insurance money belongs to mama picking on me is not going to make her give it to you to invest in any liquor stores under breath dropping into a chair and i for one say god bless mama for that walter to ruth see did you hear did you hear ruth honey please go to work walter nobody in this house is ever going to understand me beneatha because you re a nut walter who s a nut beneatha you you are a nut thee is mad boy walter looking at his wife and his sister from the door very sadly the world s most backward race of people and that s a fact beneatha turning slowly in her chair and then there are all those prophets who would lead us out of the wilderness walter slams out of the house into the swamps ruth bennie why you always gotta be pickin on your brother can t you be a little sweeter sometimes door opens walter walks in he fumbles with his cap starts to speak clears throat looks everywhere but at ruth finally walter to ruth i need some money for carfare ruth looks at him then warms teasing but tenderly fifty cents she goes to her bag and gets money here take a taxi walter exits mama enters she is a woman in her early sixties full bodied and strong she is one of those women of a certain grace and beauty who wear it so unobtrusively that it takes a while to notice her dark brown face is surrounded by the total whiteness of her hair and being a woman who has adjusted to many things in life and overcome many more her face is full of strength she has we can see wit and faith of a kind that keep her eyes lit and full of interest and expectancy she is in a word a beautiful woman her bearing is perhaps most like the noble bearing of the women of the hereros of southwest africa rather as if she imagines that as she walks she still bears a basket or a vessel upon her head her speech on the other hand is as careless as her carriage is precise she is inclined to slur everything but her voice is perhaps not so much quiet as simply soft mama who that round here slamming doors at this hour she crosses through the room goes to the window opens it and brings in a feeble little plant growing doggedly in a small pot on the windowsill she feels the dirt and puts it back out ruth that was walter lee he and bennie was at it again mama my children and they tempers lord if this little old plant don t get more sun than it s been getting it ain t never going to see spring again she turns from the window what s the matter with you this morning ruth you looks right peaked you aiming to iron all them things leave some for me i ll get to em this afternoon bennie honey it s too drafty for you to be sitting round half dressed where s your robe beneatha in the cleaners mama well go get mine and put it on beneatha i m not cold mama honest mama i know but you so thin beneatha irritably mama i m not cold mama seeing the make down bed as travis has left it lord have mercy look at that poor bed bless his heart he tries don t he she moves to the bed travis has sloppily made up ruth no he don t half try at all cause he knows you going to come along behind him and fix everything that s just how come he don t know how to do nothing right now you done spoiled that boy so mama folding bedding well he s a little boy ain t supposed to know bout housekeeping my baby that s what he is what you fix for his breakfast this morning ruth angrily i feed my son lena mama i ain t meddling under breath busy bodyish i just noticed all last week he had cold cereal and when it starts getting this chilly in the fall a child ought to have some hot grits or something when he goes out in the cold ruth furious i gave him hot oats is that all right mama i ain t meddling pause put a lot of nice butter on it ruth shoots her an angry look and does not reply he likes lots of butter ruth exasperated lena mama to beneatha mama is inclined to wander conversationally sometimes what was you and your brother fussing bout this morning beneatha it s not important mama she gets up and goes to look out at the bathroom which is apparently free and she picks up her towels and rushes out mama what was they fighting about ruth now you know as well as i do mama shaking her head brother still worrying his self sick about that money ruth you know he is mama you had breakfast ruth some coffee mama girl you better start eating and looking after yourself better you almost thin as travis ruth lena mama un hunh ruth what are you going to do with it mama now don t you start child it s too early in the morning to be talking about money it ain t christian ruth it s just that he got his heart set on that store mama you mean that liquor store that willy harris want him to invest in ruth yes mama we ain t no business people ruth we just plain working folks ruth ain t nobody business people till they go into business walter lee say colored people ain t never going to start getting ahead till they start gambling on some different kinds of things in the world investments and things mama what done got into you girl walter lee done finally sold you on investing ruth no mama something is happening between walter and me i don t know what it is but he needs something something i can t give him anymore he needs this chance lena mama frowning deeply but liquor honey ruth well like walter say i spec people going to always be drinking themselves some liquor mama well whether they drinks it or not ain t none of my business but whether i go into business selling it to em is and i don t want that on my ledger this late in life stopping suddenly and studying her daughter in law ruth younger what s the matter with you today you look like you could fall over right there ruth i m tired mama then you better stay home from work today ruth i can t stay home she d be calling up the agency and screaming at them my girl didn t come in today send me somebody my girl didn t come in oh she just have a fit mama well let her have it i ll just call her up and say you got the flu ruth laughing why the flu mama cause it sounds respectable to em something white people get too they know bout the flu otherwise they think you been cut up or something when you tell em you sick ruth i got to go in we need the money mama somebody would of thought my children done all but starved to death the way they talk about money here late child we got a great big old check coming tomorrow ruth sincerely but also self righteously now that s your money it ain t got nothing to do with me we all feel like that walter and bennie and me even travis mama thoughtfully and suddenly very far away ten thousand dollars ruth sure is wonderful mama ten thousand dollars ruth you know what you should do miss lena you should take yourself a trip somewhere to europe or south america or someplace mama throwing up her hands at the thought oh child ruth i m serious just pack up and leave go on away and enjoy yourself some forget about the family and have yourself a ball for once in your life mama drily you sound like i m just about ready to die who d go with me what i look like wandering round europe by myself ruth shoot these here rich white women do it all the time they don t think nothing of packing up they suitcases and piling on one of them big steamships and swoosh they gone child mama something always told me i wasn t no rich white woman ruth well what are you going to do with it then mama i ain t rightly decided thinking she speaks now with emphasis some of it got to be put away for beneatha and her schoolin and ain t nothing going to touch that part of it nothing she waits several seconds trying to make up her mind about something and looks at ruth a little tentatively before going on been thinking that we maybe could meet the notes on a little old two story somewhere with a yard where travis could play in the summertime if we use part of the insurance for a down payment and everybody kind of pitch in i could maybe take on a little day work again few days a week ruth studying her mother in law furtively and concentrating on her ironing anxious to encourage without seeming to well lord knows we ve put enough rent into this here rat trap to pay for four houses by now mama looking up at the words rat trap and then looking around and leaning back and sighing in a suddenly reflective mood rat trap yes that s all it is smiling i remember just as well the day me and big walter moved in here hadn t been married but two weeks and wasn t planning on living here no more than a year she shakes her head at the dissolved dream we was going to set away little by little don t you know and buy a little place out in morgan park we had even picked out the house chuckling a little looks right dumpy today but lord child you should know all the dreams i had bout buying that house and fixing it up and making me a little garden in the back she waits and stops smiling and didn t none of it happen dropping her hands in a futile gesture ruth keeps her head down ironing yes life can be a barrel of disappointments sometimes mama honey big walter would come in here some nights back then and slump down on that couch there and just look at the rug and look at me and look at the rug and then back at me and i d know he was down then really down after a second very long and thoughtful pause she is seeing back to times that only she can see and then lord when i lost that baby little claude i almost thought i was going to lose big walter too oh that man grieved hisself he was one man to love his children ruth ain t nothin can tear at you like losin your baby mama i guess that s how come that man finally worked hisself to death like he done like he was fighting his own war with this here world that took his baby from him ruth he sure was a fine man all right i always liked mr younger mama crazy bout his children god knows there was plenty wrong with walter younger hard headed mean kind of wild with women plenty wrong with him but he sure loved his children always wanted them to have something be something that s where brother gets all these notions i reckon big walter used to say he d get right wet in the eyes sometimes lean his head back with the water standing in his eyes and say seem like god didn t see fit to give the black man nothing but dreams but he did give us children to make them dreams seem worth while she smiles he could talk like that don t you know ruth yes he sure could he was a good man mr younger mama yes a fine man just couldn t never catch up with his dreams that s all beneatha comes in brushing her hair and looking up to the ceiling where the sound of a vacuum cleaner has started up beneatha what could be so dirty on that woman s rugs that she has to vacuum them every single day ruth i wish certain young women round here who i could name would take inspiration about certain rugs in a certain apartment i could also mention beneatha shrugging how much cleaning can a house need for christ s sakes mama not liking the lord s name used thus bennie ruth just listen to her just listen beneatha oh god mama if you use the lord s name just one more time beneatha a bit of a wh,"['page', 'nurse', 'asleep', 'drop', 'brown',

with narrator narrator in may fidel castro in an effort to normalize relations with the carter administration opened the harbor at mariel cuba with the apparent intention of letting some of his people join their relatives in the united states within seventy two hours u s boats were headed for cuba in the next few weeks it became evident that castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back with them not only their relatives but the dregs of his jail population by the time the port was closed marielitos had landed in florida an estimated had criminal records this is the story of that minority those they call los bandidos the prologue is shredded diagonally by the blade of a stiletto and in the empty black void we cut to opening montage documentary footage the disembarkation from the harbor in mariel cuba vessels of every nature waving masses demonstrations the crossing sun and storm the landing key west the flag of the united states choppers swooping over the ragged coastline of the keys emerald waters dotted with fishing trawlers and pleasure craft an america the beautiful type immigration theme surging over this the processing long lines immigration and nationalization officials customs public health fbi church and relief organizations babies bawling arguments over paperwork refugees being interviewed by tv news people crying people eating families huddled on floors chaos the music theme continuing in stately calm as we cut to int office processing hall afternoon a full and closeup of tony montana the scar faced one in the young angry prime of his life we dwell first on the scar which he likes to scratch now and then we move to the eyes pure in their fury finally we encompass the face the face of a man about to explode muscle tissue brain a man willing to live or die and on the increment of a moment inflict or receive either one he is clothed in rags crossed with holes his shoes broken cardboard his hair unkempt his complexion sallow from prison over this voice o s okay so what do you call yourself voice o s como se llama montana tony montana you voice where d you learn to speak the english tony montana my old man he was american sailor bum i

tony tony me jail no way we now reveal three men in civilian clothing in the dark afternoon light of the little room actually it s a plywood office somewhere in the processing hall and we hear the din from the hall over the question and answer two of the men sit around a desk the third man stands in a corner staring at tony the most authoritative looking of the three man l checking off a list you been in a mental hospital tony tony grinning yeah in the boat coming over man how bout homosexuality tony you like men y like to dress up like a woman tony to man never tried it what the fuck s wrong

get the beauty scar tony this scratching the scar shrugs i was a kid you should see the other kid a grim chuckle man and this he holds up tony s hand and indicates the tattoo between the thumb and second finger a heart with the word madre scaled through it tony oh that was for my sweetheart man sweetheart to the other men we been seeing more and more of these it s some kinda code these guys

to me harry castro didn t do nothing that taunting smile on tony s lips as to the music of the immigration theme we dissolve to a int federal bus hour later a the bus is packed with the harder looking refugee types the windows are caged and we see ins guards the noise level is high like a sack of monkeys manny manolo ribera s got his feet up on an empty seat he s big strong handsome with dashing darkly feminine eyes younger than tony and dapper in his cheap clothing he s eating a baby ruth candy bar manny seat s taken tony so i ll sit in your lap tony pushes his feet off sits he takes the baby ruth out of manny s hand peels out the bar of chocolate then returns the empty wrapper to manny tony so what d you tell them manny i told them what you told me to tell them i told them i was in sanitation in cuba tony i didn t tell you sanitation i told you to tell them you was in a sanitarium not sanitation the bus pulling out now manny is that what you told me you didn t tell me that tony

b ext miami from bus establishing shot b of miami as to the music of the immigration theme we dissolve to int tony s tent freedomtown night six months later a movie projector the face of bogart unshaven paranoid we re watching a badly damaged mm print of the treasure of the sierra madre it s near the end of the film and he s alone talking to himself just before the bandits get him the rag tag audience is noisily yammering back at the screen the camera moving past manny ray chewing gum hair slicked eyes in cat like repose to tony enrapt eyes like an eleven year old mouth hanging open bogart what a thing conscience conscience if you believe you ve got a conscience it ll pester you to death but if you don t believe you ve got one what can it do to you makes me sick so much talking and fussing about nonsense time to go to sleep closes his eyes but not for long cut to int tent later that night tony is moving down rd street the walk proud and jungle in the rock of the hips and the cast of the shoulders now accompanied by his handsome compadre manny tony that bogart chico hunh manny fucking crazy hunh tony that gold dust blowing in the wind y see manny he s always looking over his shoulder hunh like me he hunches darting exaggerated looks over his shoulder imitating bogart manny laughs in his black shirt with zig zag dots and colors and the baggy pants and sunglasses tony s starting to look american he s even got himself a pop button pinned to his shirt that says fuck off and die and his english rolls faster off his tongue his confidence more pronounced tony don t trust nobody manny yeah all that gold hunh i guess you get so crazy you never trust nobody no more tony never happen to me chico that s one thing i never gonna be i never gonna be crazy like that manny yeah

middle of the boulevard where a bustling black market in toiletries clothing cigarettes and transvestites is conducted nightly in the harsh glare of barrack neon he ambles past a bunch of young guys throwing a frisbee past a viva carter proclamation in graffiti transvestite passing what about you sugar you wanna party tony passing her yeah with whose cock honey cut to ext freedomtown grounds night tony five minutes later in a phone booth in the middle of a bank of them dozens of marielietos pressing to get in trying still to contact somebody anybody on the outside tony is dialing his eyes shifting down to the telephone number written in pencil on the back of a snapshot as he finishes the number he flips the snapshot over and we see a young girl about thirteen years old dark tiny fiery

tawaddud fn there was once in baghdad a man of consequence and rich in monies and immoveables who was one of the chiefs of the merchants and allah had largely endowed him with worldly goods but had not vouchsafed him what he longed for of offspring and there passed over him a long space of time without his being blessed with issue male or female his years waxed great his bones became wasted and his back bent weakness and weariness grew upon him and he feared the loss of his wealth and possessions seeing he had no child whom he might make his heir and by whom his name should be remembered so he betook himself with supplication to almighty allah fasting by day and praying through the night moreover he vowed many vows to the living the eternal and visited the pious and was constant in supplication to the most highest till he gave ear to him and accepted his prayer and took pity on his straining and complaining so that before many days were past he knew carnally one of his women and she conceived by him the same night in due time she finished her months and casting her burden bore a male child as he were a slice of the moon whereupon the merchant fulfilled his vows in his gratitude to allah to whom be honour and glory and gave alms and clothed the widow and the orphan on the seventh night after the boy s birth he named him abu al husn fn and the wet nurses suckled him and the dry nurses dandled him and the servants and the slaves carried him and handled him till he shot up and grew tall and throve greatly and learnt the sublime koran and the ordinances of al islam and the canons of the true faith and calligraphy and poetry and mathematics and archery on this wise he became the union pearl of his age and the goodliest of the folk of his time and his day fair of face and of tongue fluent carrying himself with a light and graceful gait and glorying in his stature proportionate and amorous graces which were to many a bait and his cheeks were red and flower white was his forehead and his side face waxed brown with tender down even as saith one describing him the spring of the down on cheeks right clearly shows and how nbsp when the spring is gone shall last the rose dost thou not see that the growth upon his cheek is violet nbsp bloom that from its leaves outgrows he abode awhile in ease and happiness with his father who rejoiced and delighted in him till he came to man s estate when the merchant one day made him sit down before him and said o my son the appointed term draweth near my hour of death is at hand and it remaineth but to meet allah to whom belong majesty and might i leave thee what shall suffice thee even to thy son s son of monies and mansions farms and gardens wherefore fear thou almighty allah o my son in dealing with that which i bequeath to thee and follow none but those who will help thee to the divine favour not long after he sickened and died so his son ordered his funeral fn after the goodliest wise and burying

is past and fled and mourning beseemeth none but the young maid and the wife cloistered and they ceased not from him till they wrought on him to enter the hammam and break off his mourning and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say when it was the four hundred and thirty seventh night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when abu al husn was visited by his friends and taken to the hamman and persuaded to break off his mourning he presently forgot his father s charge and his head was turned by his riches he thought fortune would always wone with him as it was and that wealth would ever wax and never wane so he ate and drank and made merry and took his pleasure and gave gifts of gear and coin and was profuse with gold and addrest himself up to eating fowls and breaking the seals of wine flasks and listening to the giggle of the daughter of the vine as she gurgled from the flagon and enjoying the jingle of the singing girls nor did he give over this way of life till his wealth was wasted and the case worsened and all his goods went from him and he bit his hands fn in bitter penitence for of a truth he had nothing left after that which he had squandered but a concubine a slave girl whom his father had bequeathed to him with the rest of his estate and she had no equal in beauty and loveliness and brightness and liveliness

dress and scent myself i slay in fine i have reached a pitch of perfection such as can be estimated only by those of them who are firmly rooted in knowledge fn now when the caliph heard these words spoken by one so young he wondered at her eloquence and turning to abu al husn said i will summon those who shall discuss with her all she claimeth to know if she answer correctly i will give thee the price thou askest for her and more and if not thou art fitter to have her than i with gladness and goodly gree o commander of the faithful replied abu al husn so the caliph wrote to the viceroy of bassorah to send him ibrahim bin siyy r the prosodist who was the first man of his day in argument and eloquence and poetry and logic and bade him bring with him readers of the koran and learned doctors of the law and physicians and astrologers and scientists and mathematicians and philosophers and ibrahim was more learned than all in a little while they arrived at the palace of the caliphate knowing not what was to do and the caliph sent for them to his sitting chamber and ordered them to be seated so they sat down and he bade bring the damsel tawaddud who came and unveiling showed herself as she were a sparkling star fn the caliph set her a stool of gold and she saluted and speaking with an eloquent tongue said o commander of the faithful bid the olema and the doctors of law and leaches and astrologers and scientists and mathematicians and all here present contend with me in argument so he said to them i desire of you that ye dispute with this damsel on the things of her faith and stultify her argument in all she advanceth and they answered saying we hear and we obey allah and thee o commander of the faithful upon this tawaddud bowed her head and said which of you is

the millions and millions and millions of viewers who tune in during prime time to watch the presentations it is not a coincidence that the oscars ceremony is held during tv s sweeps week we pretty much all tune in despite the grotesquerie of watching an industry congratulate itself on its pretense that it s still an art form of hearing people in gowns invoke lush clich s of surprise and humility scripted by publicists etc the whole cynical postmodern deal but we all still seem to watch to care even though the hypocrisy hurts even though opening grosses and marketing strategies are now bigger news than the movies themselves even though cannes and sundance have become nothing more than enterprise zones but the truth is that there s no more real joy about it all anymore worse there seems to be this enormous unspoken conspiracy where we all pretend that there s still joy that we think it s funny when bob dole does a visa ad and gorbachev shills for pizza hut that the whole

this thick beautifully designed magazine costs per issue is about percent ads and is clearly targeted at adult video retailers its circulation is appr though the sub line vagaries of entertainment accounting are legendary it is universally acknowledged that the us adult film industry at billion in annual sales rentals cable charges and video masturbation booth revenues is an even larger and more efficient moneymaking machine than legitimate mainstream american cinema the latter s annual gross commonly estimated at billion the us adult industry is centered in la s san fernando valley just over the mountains from hollywood some insiders like to refer to the adult industry as hollywood s evil twin others as the mainstream s big red son it is no accident that adult video news a slick expensive periodical whose articles are really more like infomercials and its yearly awards both came into being in the early s after all saw the genesis of vcrs and home video rentals which have done

met is mercifully absent from the awards gala the emcee is one robert schimmel alumnus of in living color and a howard stern regular schimmel looks like a depraved deeply tan wallace shawn and is no less coarse than b slayton but a lot better he does a pantomime of someone attempting intercourse with a love doll he s been too lazy to blow up all the way he contrasts the woeful paucity of his own ejaculate with the concussive orgasms of certain well known male performers comparing these men s ejaculations to automatic lawn sprinklers and doing an eerie sonic impression of same all of s marginal print journalists are together at table at the very back of the ballroom most of these reporters are from the sorts of men s magazines that sit shrinkwrapped behind the cash registers of

anabolic video table nearby keep looking over in annoyance at one point during a routine on premature ejaculation dick filth actually chokes on a california roll but all this is saturday night the main event and there are a whole lot of festivities preceding saturday s climax the adult industry is vulgar would anyone disagree one of the avn awards categories is best anal themed feature another is best overall marketing campaign company image irresistible a winner in several categories has been spelled irresistable in adult video news for fifteen straight years the industry s not only vulgar it s predictably vulgar all the clich s are true the typical porn producer really is the ugly little man with a bad toupee and a pinkie ring the size of a rolaids the typical porn director really is the guy who uses the word class as a noun to mean refinement the typical porn starlet really is the lady in lycra eveningwear with tattoos all down her arms who s both smoking and chewing gum while telling journalists how grateful she is to wadcutter productions ltd for footing her breast enlargement bill and meaning it the whole avn awards weekend comprises what mr dick filth calls an irony free zone but of course we should keep in mind that vulgar has many dictionary definitions and that only a couple of these have to do w lewdness or bad taste at root vulgar just means popular on a mass scale it is the semantic opposite of pretentious or snobby it is humility with a comb over it is nielsen ratings and barnum s axiom and the real bottom line it is big big business thirty four

s caesars for modern porn s awards show here the aavnas are one more spectacle way more tourists and conventioneers recognize the starlets than you d expect double takes all over the hotel even just standing around or putting coins in a slot machine the performers become a prime attraction las vegas doesn t miss a trick the annual avn awards are always scheduled to coincide with the international consumer electronics show a k a ces which this year runs from through january the ces is a very big deal it s like a combination convention and talent show for the best and brightest in the world of consumer tech steve forbes is here and dss s thomson sun microsystems is using this year s ces to launch its personaljava bill gates gives a packed house speech on saturday morning major players from tv cable and merchandising host a panel on the short term viability of hdtv a forum on the problem of product returns by disgruntled customers seats and is sro the ces as a whole is bigger than your correspondents hometowns it s spread out over four different hotels and has booths with everything from the first ever full text message pager in a wristwatch to the world s premier self heating home satellite dish the snow and ice solution but far and away the ces s most popular venue with total attendance well over every year is what is called the adult software exhibition despite the fact that the ces itself treats the adult tradeshow kind of like the crazy relative in the family and keeps it way out in what used to be the parking garage of the sands hotel this facility a serious bus ride from all the other ces sites is an enormous windowless all cement space that during show hours manages to induce both agoraphobia and claustrophobia a big sign says you have to be to get in the median age inside is almost all males nearly everyone wearing some sort of conventioneer s nametag every production company in the adult industry from anabolic to zane has a booth here the really big companies have booths that are sprawling and multidisplay and more like small strip malls a lot of porn s top female performers are contract players exclusive vendors to one particular production company and one reason why a lot of the starlets seem kind of tired and cranky by saturday night s awards gala is that they will have spent much of the previous hours at their companies ces booths on their feet all day in vertiginous heels signing autographs and posing for pictures and pressing all manner of flesh the best way to describe the sonic environment at the ces is imagine that the apocalypse took the form of a cocktail party male fans move through the fractal maze of booths in groups of three or more their expressions tend to be those of junior high boys at a peephole an expression that looks pretty surreal on a face with jowls and no hairline some among them are video retailers most are not most are just hard core fans the industry s breath and bread a lot of them not only recognize but seem to know the names stage names and curricula vitae of almost all the female performers it takes an average of two hours and twelve minutes to traverse the adult ces expo counting an average of four delays for getting lost after a chicane turn or some baroque ceiling high cheval glass designed to double the visual exposure of heatwave video s display for texas dildo masquerade gets you all turned around your correspondents are accompanied by harold hecuba and dick filth who have very generously offered to act as guides and docents and here is a random spatter of the things we see the first time we come in a second tier arrow video starlet in a g string poses for a photo forked dorsally over the knee of a morbidly obese cellphone retailer from suburban philadelphia the guy taking the picture whose ces nametag says hi and that his name is sherm addresses the starlet as babe and asks her to readjust so as to give us a little more bush down there an elegant angel starlet with polyresin wings attached to her back is eating a milky way bar while she signs video boxes actor steven st croix is standing near the caballero home video booth saying to no one in particular let me out of here i can t wait to get out of here adult video stores all have a distinctive smell a mix of cheap magnetic tape and disinfectant and the sands former parking garage is rank with it asian businessmen move through the aisles in dense graceful packs and are assiduously cheery and polite a young guy in a full color frankenstein t shirt is spraypainting cartoon flames on an actress s breasts at the sin city booth the actress an obscure one not even filth and hecuba know her name has normal size breasts and there s not much of an audience producer director max hardcore draws a way bigger crowd at the maxworld booth where one of his girls is squatting on the countertop masturbating with the butt of a riding crop max s videos promotional posters have him carrying a girl in minishorts over his shoulder against the backdrop of various city skylines the pitches at the bottom say see pretty girls sodomized in manners most foul see cum splattered girls too stupid to know better max is a story all to himself according to harold hecuba d filth and a porn executive dressed entirely in campbell nightwatch plaid are smoking cigars and keep holding their cigars up together and comparing the ash to see which one has the cleanest burn a lot of the industry males and even some of the starlets are also smoking cigars is definitely the year of the cigar the starlets are all in either extremely formal cocktail dresses or else abbreviated latex vinyl lycra ensembles heels are uniformly sharp and ultrahigh some of the starlets are so heavily made up they look embalmed they tend to have complexly coiffed hair that looks really good from feet away but on closer inspection is dry and dead someone who is either sometime performer jeff marton or bizarro sleaze filmmaker gregory dark is doing sleight of hand tricks with his trademark fedora whoever he is he has a goatee harold hecuba also has a goatee dick filth has more like a soul patch h h and d f longtime industry journalists know everybody here and keep getting stopped and drawn into conversations these delays during which yr corresps sort of stand there awkwardly at the edge of the conversation and try to look around as if they too know people here and are waiting only to spot them in the crowd before they go off and get into their own involved conversations have not been included in the minute adult ces traversal average this year a good percent of the males in and around the porn industry appear to be sporting variants of the goatee next to the outlaw video booth a starlet in a gold lam spaghetti strap gown chewing gum and blowing large blue bubbles is being videotaped by a disabled fan whose camera and parabolic mike are bolted to the arm of his wheelchair the starlet is pointing to the tattoos on her left arm and appears to be explaining the origin and context of each one at the vivid video multibooth complex ms taylor hayes has what is probably the longest autograph and flesh press line in the entire sands garage taylor is major league pretty she looks like a slightly debauched cindy crawford and an oversize monitor suspended from the ceiling over the vivid area plays clips of her scantily clad and dancing amid dry ice fumes there s a berm of boxed videos on the floor by the counter and a huge man with a visor and handheld credit card machine on taylor s right flank as she greets each fan like a long lost relative according to dick filth taylor is both a genuinely nice person and a consummate pro the booth for xplor media a company known for its southern belles video series and orgy for world peace website is arresting because all the execs at xplor seem to be under and the booth s atmosphere is that of a fraternity party in its third straight day one young bald guy is unconscious in a fetal position on the counter and some wag has glued all sorts of feathers and flaccid plastic two headed dildoish things to his skull xplor s owner auteurs are two brothers trust fund babies from a connecticut suburb of nyc their names are farrel and moffitt timlake farrel who wears twelve hole doc martens and cargo pants and what s either a very light parka or very heavy sweatshirt with a hood that stays up at all times is a particular cause c l bre at the ces because he s apparently a friend of the two guys who do south park and these guys are rumored to be in vegas and to possess tickets to saturday s awards banquet everyone without exception is sweating at all but a few of the booths contract starlets treat the fans with the same absent rigid faced courtesy that flight attendants and restaurant hostesses tend to use you can tell how bored the performers are by the way their faces light up when they see someone they know well over half of the industry s current superstars are in this huge room the infamous t t boy is here standing alone with his trademark glower the boy who is rumored to bring a semiautomatic pistol with him to the set and who was featured in a new yorker article that was full of lines like a porn shoot is an intricately delineated ecology mr vince vouyer sic is on hand as are seth gecko jake steed serenity missy and nick east here is the ageless randy west who looks just the way a surfer would look if that surfer were also a mob enforcer with his perennial tan and hair like frozen surf mr jon dough winner of avn s coveted best actor video statuette in both and alternates between various booths wearing his customary expression of having psychologically evolved to the point where he s so incredibly cool and detached that life is one long yawn here also is mark davis far and away the most handsome of the current males a near double for gregory harrison of the old trapper john series except for davis s ultrashort psych patient haircut plus goatee and year veteran joey silvera is at this year s ces though mostly in his capacity as an auteur silvera now directs evil angel s popular butt row video series following the lead of pioneers like john leslie and paul thomas most of today s top male stars now also direct and per the store boxes present their own line of videos e g tom byron s cumback pussy series jon dough s dirty stories the eye popping rocco siffredi s various european cities by night line etc the so and so presents series seems to be an industry trend like cigars and goatees it is difficult to describe how it feels to gaze at living human beings whom you ve seen perform in hard core porn to shake the hand of a man whose precise erectile size angle and vasculature are known to you that strange i think we ve met before sensation one feels upon seeing any celebrity in the flesh is here both intensified and twisted it feels intensely twisted to see reigning industry queen jenna jameson chilling out at the vivid booth in jordaches and a latex bustier and to know already that she has a tattoo of a sundered valentine with the tagline heart breaker on her right buttock and a tiny hairless mole just left of her anus to watch peter north try to get a cigar lit and to have that sight backlit by memories of his artilleryesque ejaculations to have seen these strangers faces in orgasm that most unguarded and purely neural of expressions the one so vulnerable that for centuries you basically had to marry a person to get to see it this weirdness may account for some of the complex emotional intercourse taking place between the performers and fans at the adult ces the patrons may leer and elbow one another at a distance but by the time the men get to the front of the line and face the living incarnation of their vcr s fantasy babe most of them turn into quivering goggle eyed schoolboys sheepish and salivaless and damp the same thing evidently happens at the hundreds of strip clubs all over the country where porn starlets appear as featured dancers for five figures a week according to filth and do photos and autographs after the show most of these guys become incredibly nervous when i come up to them veteran starlet shane has explained i ll put my arms around a guy and his whole body will be trembling they pretty much do whatever i tell them to do the whole industry now has this oddly reversed equation the consumers are the ones who seem ashamed or shy while the performers are cocky and smooth and percent pro it is no longer the s and the meese commission mentality that led to a major crackdown on video porn is long gone federal task forces and pta outrage are now focused on the internet and kiddie porn but today s adult industry is still hypersensitive about what it perceives as fascist attacks on its first amendment freedoms a specially prepared trailer now runs before many higher end adult videos right between the legal disclaimer on the product s compliance with or exemption from u s c and ads for phone services like fuck against shots of flowing flags and the lincoln memorial a voiceover says stuff like censorship goes against our bill of rights and the founding principles of this country it is an attempt on the part of the government to legislate morality and to stifle free expression this new legal morality is dangerous to all americans vote for those who believe in limiting government intrusion into your personal affairs vote against government control of your life and home vote against censorship only you the people can keep the american ideal intact these trailers always say they re sponsored by either the adult video association or something called the free speech coalition both organizations and the extent to which the two are separate is unclear are basically industry pacs porn in other words has taken the political lessons of the s to heart it is now a hard lobbying political force no less than gm or rjr nabisco feminists of all different stripe oppose the adult industry for reasons having to do with pornography s putative effects on women their arguments are well known and in some respects persuasive but certain antiporn arguments in the s are now centered on adult entertainment s alleged effects on the men who consume it some masculists believe that a lot of men get addicted to video porn in a way that causes grievous psychic harm example an essayist named david mura has a little book called a male grief notes on pornography and addiction which is a bit new agey but interesting in places e g at the essence of pornography is the image of flesh used as a drug a way of numbing psychic pain but this drug lasts only as long as the man stares at the image in pornographic perception each gesture each word each image is read first and foremost through sexuality love or tenderness pity or compassion become subsumed by and are made subservient to a greater deity a more powerful force the addict to pornography desires to be blinded to live in a dream those in the thrall of pornography try to eliminate from their consciousness the world outside pornography and this includes everything from their family and friends or last sunday s sermon to the political situation in the middle east in engaging in such elimination the viewer reduces himself he becomes stupid this kind of stuff might sound a little out there maybe until one observes the eerie similarity between the eyes of males in strip clubs or stroke parlors and the eyes of people in their fifth hour of pumping silver dollars into the slot machines of the sands casino or maybe until one s seen firsthand the odd kind of shock on the faces of ces patrons seeing performers now in the flesh complete with chewing gum and chin pimples and all the human stuff you never see never want to see in films maybe just a little bit more here on the whole scene at the adult ces which is a lot more of a rub elbows type venue than the stylized awards ceremony is going to end up being mr harold hecuba is deep in conversation with a marginal porn producer about one of his performers being sidelined with something called a prolapsed sphincter which condition yr corresps decline to follow up on in any way we are standing just west of a staff writer for digital horizons who s dropped by to scope out the legendary scene in here again this year and is telling two presumed other tech writers that being around porn people always makes him feel like he s been somehow astrally projected onto a cocktail napkin it is also roughly now that ms jasmin st claire is making an appearance at the impressive media booth in order to spell the starlet behind the counter who is limping to the booth s rear area she i e the limping starlet has reportedly had to be sprayed with silicon to fit into her pants the crowd at the impressive media venue immediately starts to enlarge jasmin st claire is wearing a red vinyl jacket and miniskirt ensemble a porn starlet entering any kind of room or area has a distinctive energy about her you turn your head to look even if you don t seem to want to it s like watching a figure from a pinball machine illustration or high concept comic book step out into d and head your way it turns out really to be possible to feel as though your eyeballs are protruding slightly from their sockets what makes the whole thing so weird is that jasmin st claire isn t even all that pretty at least not today her hair is dyed black in that cheap unreal goth way and she is so incredibly heavily made up that she looks like a crow she is also somewhat knock kneed plus of course has the requisite howitzer grade bust ms st claire is being escorted to the impressive booth by two large men whose expressions are describable only as mug shottish this is another thing about porn starlets they re never alone they re always accompanied by at least one and sometimes as many as four flinty eyed males the impression is that of a very expensive thoroughbred being led onto the track under a silk blanket fyi ms jasmin st claire s cult celebrity status at the ces stems from her having broken the world gang bang record by taking on men in a row in amazing pictures world s biggest gang bang since most of these men were amateur porn fans who d had only to fill out an application and produce an hiv all clear from the dph she now enjoys an almost legendary populist appeal the people s porn star and an enormous serpentine line of fans with cameras and autographable memorabilia has formed at the impressive booth which line ms st claire appears for the moment to be ignoring because she and h hecuba having exchanged double cheek kisses are now deep into some kind of t te t te above the sockless docksiders of the unconscious bald kid who s the kid has evidently been carried or trundled by pranksters unknown from the xplor counter right next door to this one dick filth after your correspondents have remarked on how it s kind of heartwarming that everyone in the porn industry all seem to be friends even critics and performers dishes an involved anecdote about how jasmin st claire apparently once actually tried to strangle harold hecuba at an industry soir e a couple years ago an anecdote which if you re interested appears as fn just below twenty feet away over at xplor mr farrel timlake has meanwhile produced what is alleged to be the prototype and world s only authorized kenny action figure from the upcoming south park merchandising line fourteen inches tall kind of heavy for a doll w hood up and face obscured not unlike f timlake s own hood and face and is entertaining some of the im crowd s spillover by manipulating the doll s limbs to simulate its tok ing a bone not unlike urban gangs police carnival workers and certain other culturally marginalized guilds the us porn industry is occluded and insular in a way that makes it seem like high school there are cliques anticliques alliances betrayals conflagratory rumors legendary enmities and public bloodlettings plus involved hierarchies of popularity and influence you re either in or you re not performers being the industry s fissile core are of course in despite their financial power studio execs and producers are not very in and directors especially those who ve never undergone the initiation of having on camera sex themselves are less in than the performers film reviewers and industry journalists are even less in than execs and nonindustry journalists are way way non in almost as low caste as the great mass of porn fans themselves for which fans the insider term is mook the foregoing is meant to help explain how exactly your correspondents ended up in porn titan max hardcore s personal suite at the sahara and got to hang out in the suite s living room with max certain of his crew porn starlets alex dane and caressa savage and two b girls which is

a childhood by frank mccourt this book is dedicated to my brothers malachy michael alphonsus i learn from you i admire you and i love you acknowledgments this is a small hymn to an exaltation of women r lene dahlberg fanned the embers lisa schwarzbaum read early pages and encouraged me mary breasted smyth elegant novelist herself read the first third and passed it on to molly friedrich who became my agent and thought that nan graham editor in chief at scribner would be just the right person to put the book on the road and molly was right my daughter maggie has shown me how life can be a grand adventure while exquisite moments with my granddaughter chiara have helped me recall a small child s wonder my wife ellen listened while i read and cheered me to the final page i am blessed among men i my father and mother should have stayed in new york where they met and married and where i was born instead they returned to ireland when i was four my brother malachy three the twins oliver and eugene barely one and my sister margaret dead and gone when i look back on my childhood i wonder how i survived at all it was of course a miserable childhood the happy childhood is hardly worth your while worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable irish childhood and worse yet is the miserable irish catholic childhood people everywhere brag and whimper about the woes of their early years but nothing can compare with the irish version the poverty the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire pompous priests bullying schoolmasters the english and the terrible things they did to us for eight hundred long years above all we were wet out in the atlantic ocean great sheets of rain gathered to drift slowly up the river shannon and settle forever in limerick the rain dampened the city from the feast of the circumcision to new year s eve it created a cacophony of hacking coughs bronchial rattles asthmatic wheezes consumptive croaks it turned noses into fountains lungs into bacterial sponges it provoked cures galore to ease the catarrh you boiled onions in milk blackened with pepper for the congested passages you made a paste of boiled flour and nettles wrapped it in a rag and slapped it sizzling on the chest from october to april the walls of limerick glistened with the damp clothes never dried tweed and woolen coats housed living things sometimes sprouted mysterious vegetations in pubs steam rose from damp bodies and garments to be inhaled with cigarette and pipe smoke laced with the stale fumes of spilled stout and whiskey and tinged with the odor of piss wafting in from the outdoor jakes where many a man puked up his week s wages the rain drove us into the church our refuge our strength our only dry place at mass benediction novenas we huddled in great damp clumps dozing through priest drone while steam rose again from our clothes to mingle with the sweetness of incense flowers and candles limerick gained a reputation for piety but we knew it was only the rain my father malachy mccourt was born on a farm in toome county antrim like his father before he grew up wild in trouble with the english or the irish or both he fought with the old ira and for some desperate act he wound up a fugitive with a price on his head when i was a child i would look at my father the thinning hair the collapsing teeth and wonder why anyone would give money for a head like that when i was thirteen my father s mother told me a secret as a wee lad your poor father was dropped on his head it was an accident he was never the same after and you must remember that people dropped on their heads can be a bit peculiar because of the price on the head he had been dropped on he had to be spirited out of ireland via cargo ship from galway in new york with prohibition in full swing he thought he had died and gone to hell for his sins then he discovered speakeasies and he rejoiced after wandering and drinking in america and england he yearned for peace in his declining years he returned to belfast which erupted all around him he said a pox on all their houses and chatted with the ladies of andersontown they tempted him with delicacies but he waved them away and drank his tea he no longer smoked or touched alcohol so what was the use it was time to go and he died in the royal victoria hospital my mother the former angela sheehan grew up in a limerick slum with her mother two brothers thomas and patrick and a sister agnes she never saw her father who had run off to australia weeks before her birth after a night of drinking porter in the pubs of limerick he staggers down the lane singing his favorite song who threw the overalls in mrs murphy s chowder nobody spoke so he said it all the louder it s a dirty irish trick and i can lick the mick who threw the overalls in murphy s chowder he s in great form altogether and he thinks he ll play a while with little patrick one year old lovely little fella loves his daddy laughs when daddy throws him up in the air upsy daisy little paddy upsy daisy up in the air in the dark so dark oh jasus you miss the child on the way down and poor little patrick lands on his head gurgles a bit whimpers goes quiet grandma heaves herself from the bed heavy with the child in her belly my mother she s barely able to lift little patrick from the floor she moans a long moan over the child and turns on grandpa get out of it out if you stay here a minute longer i ll take the hatchet to you you drunken lunatic by jesus i ll swing at the end of a rope for you get out grandpa stands his ground like a man i have a right he says to stay in me own house she runs at him and he melts before this whirling dervish with a damaged child in her arms and a healthy one stirring inside he stumbles from the house up the lane and doesn t stop till he reaches melbourne in australia little pat my uncle was never the same after he grew up soft in the head with a left leg that went one way his body the other he never learned to read or write but god blessed him in another way when he started to sell newspapers at the age of eight he could count money better than the chancellor of the exchequer himself no one knew why he was called ab sheehan the abbot but all limerick loved him my mother s troubles began the night she was born there is my grandmother in the bed heaving and gasping with the labor pains praying to st gerard majella patron saint of expectant mothers there is nurse o halloran the midwife all dressed up in her finery it s new year s eve and mrs o halloran is anxious for this child to be born so that she can rush off to the parties and celebrations she tells my grandmother will you push will you push jesus mary and holy st joseph if you don t hurry with this child it won t be born till the new year and what good is that to me with me new dress never mind st gerard majella what can a man do for a woman at a time like this even if he is a saint st gerard majella my arse my grandmother switches her prayers to st ann patron saint of difficult labor but the child won t come nurse o halloran tells my grandmother pray to st jude patron saint of desperate cases st jude patron of desperate cases help me i m desperate she grunts and pushes and the infant s head appears only the head my mother and it s the stroke of midnight the new year limerick city erupts with whistles horns sirens brass bands people calling and singing happy new year should auld acquaintance be forgot and church bells all over ring out the angelus and nurse o halloran weeps for the waste of a dress that child still in there and me in me finery will you come out child will you grandma gives a great push and the child is in the world a lovely girl with black curly hair and sad blue eyes ah lord above says nurse o halloran this child is a time straddler born with her head in the new year and her arse in the old or was it her head in the old year and her arse in the new you ll have to write to the pope missus to find out what year this child was born in and i ll save this dress for next year and the child was named angela for the angelus which rang the midnight hour the new year the minute of her coming and because she was a little angel anyway love her as in childhood though feeble old and grey for you ll never miss a mother s love till she s buried beneath the clay at the st vincent de paul school angela learned to read write and calculate and by her ninth year her schooling was done she tried her hand at being a charwoman a skivvy a maid with a little white hat opening doors but she could not manage the little curtsy that is required and her mother said you don t have the knack of it you re pure useless why don t you go to america where there s room for all sorts of uselessness i ll give you the fare she arrived in new york just in time for the first thanksgiving day of the great depression she met malachy at a party given by dan macadorey and his wife minnie on classon avenue in brooklyn malachy liked angela and she liked him he had a hangdog look which came from the three months he had just spent in jail for hijacking a truck he and his friend john mcerlaine believed what they were told in the speakeasy that the truck was packed to the roof with cases of canned pork and beans neither knew how to drive and when the police saw the truck lurch and jerk along myrtle avenue they pulled it over the police searched the truck and wondered why anyone would hijack a truck containing not pork and beans but cases of buttons with angela drawn to the hangdog look and malachy lonely after three months in jail there was bound to be a knee trembler a knee trembler is the act itself done up against a wall man and woman up on their toes straining so hard their knees tremble with the excitement that s in it that knee trembler put angela in an interesting condition and of course there was talk angela had cousins the macnamara sisters delia and philomena married respectively to jimmy fortune of county mayo and tommy flynn of brooklyn itself delia and philomena were large women great breasted and fierce when they sailed along the sidewalks of brooklyn lesser creatures stepped aside respect was shown the sisters knew what was right and they knew what was wrong and any doubts could be resolved by the one holy roman catholic and apostolic church they knew that angela unmarried had no right to be in an interesting condition and they would take steps steps they took with jimmy and tommy in tow they marched to the speakeasy on atlantic avenue where malachy could be found on friday payday when he had a job the man in the speak joey cacciamani did not want to admit the sisters but philomena told him that if he wanted to keep the nose on his face and that door on its hinges he d better open up for they were there on god s business joey said awright awright you irish jeezoz trouble trouble malachy at the far end of the bar turned pale gave the great breasted ones a sickly smile offered them a drink they resisted the smile and spurned the offer delia said we don t know what class of a tribe you come from in the north of ireland philomena said there is a suspicion you might have presbyterians in your family which would explain what you did to our cousin jimmy said ah now ah now tisn t his fault if there s presbyterians in his family delia said you shuddup tommy had to join in what you did to that poor unfortunate girl is a disgrace to the irish race and you should be ashamed of yourself och i am said malachy i am nobody asked you to talk said philomena you done enough damage with your blather so shut your yap and while your yap is shut said delia we re here to see you do the right thing by our poor cousin angela sheehan malachy said och indeed indeed the right thing is the right thing and i d be glad to buy you all a drink while we have this little talk take the drink said tommy and shove it up your ass philomena said our little cousin no sooner gets off the boat than you are at her we have morals in limerick you know morals we re not like jackrabbits from antrim a place crawling with presbyterians jimmy said he don t look like a presbyterian you shuddup said delia another thing we noticed said philomena you have a very odd manner malachy smiled i do about you do says delia i think tis one of the first things we noticed you that odd manner and it gives us a very uneasy feeling tis that sneaky little presbyterian smile said philomena och said malachy it s just the trouble i have with my teeth teeth or no teeth odd manner or no odd manner you re gonna marry that girl said tommy up the middle aisle you re going och said malachy i wasn t planning to get married you know there s no work and i wouldn t be able to support married is what you re going to be said delia up the middle aisle said jimmy you shuddup said delia malachy watched them leave i m in a desperate pickle he told joey cacciamani bet your ass said joey i see them babes comin at me i jump inna hudson river malachy considered the pickle he was in he had a few dollars in his pocket from the last job and he had an uncle in san francisco or one of the other california sans wouldn t he be better off in california far from the great breasted macnamara sisters and their grim husbands he would indeed and he d have a drop of the irish to celebrate his decision and departure joey poured and the drink nearly took the lining off malachy s gullet irish indeed he told joey it was a prohibition concoction from the devil s own still joey shrugged i don t know nothing i only pour still it was better than nothing and malachy would have another and one for yourself joey and ask them two decent italians what they d like and what are you talking about of course i have the money to pay for it he awoke on a bench in the long island railroad station a cop rapping on his boots with a nightstick his escape money gone the macnamara sisters ready to eat him alive in brooklyn on the feast of st joseph a bitter day in march four months after the knee trembler malachy married angela and in august the child was born in november malachy got drunk and decided it was time to register the child s birth he thought he might name the child malachy after himself but his north of ireland accent and the alcoholic mumble confused the clerk so much he simply entered the name male on the certificate not until late december did they take male to st paul s church to be baptized and named francis after his father s father and the lovely saint of assisi angela wanted to give him a middle name munchin after the patron saint of limerick but malachy said over his dead body no son of his would have a limerick name it s hard enough going through life with one name sticking on middle names was an atrocious american habit and there was no need for a second name when you re christened after the man from assisi there was a delay the day of the baptism when the chosen godfather john mcerlaine got drunk at the speakeasy and forgot his responsibilities philomena told her husband tommy he d have to be godfather child s soul is in danger she said tommy put his head down and grumbled all right i ll be godfather but i m not goin to be responsible if he grows up like his father causin trouble and goin through life with the odd manner for if he does he can go to john mcerlaine at the speakeasy the priest said true for you tom decent man that you are fine man that never set foot inside a speakeasy malachy fresh from the speakeasy himself felt insulted and wanted to argue with the priest one sacrilege on top of another take off that collar and we ll see who s the man he had to be held back by the great breasted ones and their husbands grim angela new mother agitated forgot she was holding the child and let him slip into the baptismal font a total immersion of the protestant type the altar boy assisting the priest plucked the infant from the font and restored him to angela who sobbed and clutched him dripping to her bosom the priest laughed said he had never seen the likes that the child was a regular little baptist now and hardly needed a priest this maddened malachy again and he wanted to jump at the priest for calling the child some class of a protestant the priest said quiet man you re in god s house and when malachy said god s house my arse he was thrown out on court street because you can t say arse in god s house after baptism philomena said she had tea and ham and cakes in her house around the corner malachy said tea and she said yes tea or is it whiskey you want he said tea was grand but first he d have to go and deal with john mcerlaine who didn t have the decency to carry out his duties as godfather angela said you re only looking for an excuse to run to the speakeasy and he said as god is my witness the drink is the last thing on my mind angela started to cry your son s christening day and you have to go drinking delia told him he was a disgusting specimen but what could you expect from the north of ireland malachy looked from one to the other shifted on his feet pulled his cap down over his eyes shoved his hands deep in his trouser pockets said och aye the way they do in the far reaches of county antrim turned hurried up court street to the speakeasy on atlantic avenue where he was sure they d ply him with free drink in honor of his son s baptism at philomena s house the sisters and their husbands ate and drank while angela sat in a corner nursing the baby and crying philomena stuffed her mouth with bread and ham and rumbled at angela that s what you get for being such a fool hardly off the boat and you fall for that lunatic you shoulda stayed single put the child up for adoption and you d be a free woman today angela cried harder and delia took up the attack oh stop it angela stop it you have nobody to blame but yourself for gettin into trouble with a drunkard from the north a man that doesn t even look like a catholic him with his odd manner i d say that that malachy has a streak of the presbyterian in him right enough you shuddup jimmy if i was you said philomena i d make sure there s no more children he don t have a job so he don t an never will the way he drinks so no more children angela are you listenin to me i am philomena a year later another child was born angela called him malachy after his father and gave him a middle name gerard after his father s brother the macnamara sisters said angela was nothing but a rabbit and they wanted nothing to do with her till she came to her senses their husbands agreed i m in a playground on classon avenue in brooklyn with my brother malachy he s two i m three we re on the seesaw up down up down malachy goes up i get off malachy goes down seesaw hits the ground he screams his hand is on his mouth and there s blood oh god blood is bad my mother will kill me and here she is trying to run across the playground her big belly slows her she says what did you do what did you do to i don t know what to say i don t know what i she pulls my ear go home go to bed bed in the middle of the day she pushes me toward the playground gate go she picks up malachy and waddles off my father s friend mr macadorey is outside the child did our building he s standing at the edge of the sidewalk with his wife minnie looking at a dog lying in the gutter there is blood all around the dog s head it s the

before he died wanted to come home the poor wee creature mr macadorey says you d better go home francis i don t know what you did to your wee brother but your mother took him off to the hospital go home child will malachy die like the dog mr macadorey minnie says he bit his tongue he won t die why did the dog die it was his time francis the apartment is empty and i wander between the two rooms the bedroom and the kitchen my father is out looking for a job and my mother is at the hospital with malachy i wish i had something to eat but there s nothing in the icebox but cabbage leaves floating in the melted ice my father said never eat anything floating in water for the rot that might be in it i fall asleep on my parents bed and when my mother shakes me it s nearly dark your little brother

you tell me the story about coo coo cuchulain say it after me coo hoo lin i ll tell you the story when you say the name right coo hoo lin i say it right and he tells me the story of cuchulain who had a different name when he was a boy setanta he grew up in ireland where dad lived when he was a boy in county antrim setanta had a stick and ball and one day he hit the ball and it went into the mouth of a big dog that belonged to culain and choked him oh culain was angry and he said what am i to do now without my big dog to guard my house and my wife and my ten small children as well as numerous pigs hens sheep setanta said i m sorry i ll guard your house with my stick and ball and i ll change my name to cuchulain the hound of culain he did he guarded the house and regions beyond and became a great hero the hound of ulster itself dad said he was a greater hero than hercules or achilles that the greeks were always bragging about and he could take on king arthur and all his knights in a fair fight which of course you could never get with an englishman anyway that s my story dad can t tell that story to malachy or any other children down the hall he finishes the story and lets me sip his tea it s bitter but i m happy there on his lap for days malachy s tongue is swollen and he can hardly make a sound never mind talk but even if he could no one is paying any attention to him because we have two new babies who were brought by an angel in the middle of the night the neighbors say ooh ah they re lovely boys look at those big eyes malachy stands in the middle of the room looking up at everyone pointing to his tongue and saying uck uck when the neighbors say can t you see we re looking at your little brothers he cries till dad pats him on the head put in your tongue son and go out and play with frankie go on in the playground i tell malachy about the dog who died in the street because someone drove a ball into his mouth malachy shakes his head no uck ball car uck kill dog he cries because his tongue hurts and he can hardly talk and it s terrible when you can t talk he won t let me push him on the swing he says you uck kill me uck on seesaw he gets freddie leibowitz to push him and he s happy laughing when he swings to the sky freddie is big he s seven and i ask him to push me he says no you tried to kill your brother i try to get the swing going myself but all i can do is move it back and forth and i m angry because freddie and malachy are laughing at the way i can t swing they re great pals now freddie seven malachy two they laugh every day and malachy s tongue gets better with all the laughing when he laughs you can see how white and small and pretty his teeth are and you can see his eyes shine he has blue eyes like my mother he has golden hair and pink cheeks i have brown eyes like dad i have black hair and my cheeks are white in the mirror my mother tells mrs leibowitz down the hall that malachy is the happiest child in the world she tells mrs leibowitz down the hall frankie has the odd manner like his father i wonder what the odd manner is but i can t ask because i m not supposed to be listening i wish i could swing up into the sky up into the clouds i might be able to fly around the whole world and not hear my brothers oliver and eugene cry in the middle of the night anymore my mother says they re always hungry she cries in the middle of the night too she says she s worn out nursing and feeding and changing and four boys is too much for her she wishes she had one little girl all for herself she d give anything for one little girl i m in the playground with malachy i m four he s three he lets me push him on the swing because he s no good at swinging himself and freddie leibowitz is in school we have to stay in the playground because the twins are sleeping and my mother says she s worn out go out and play she says and give me some rest dad is out looking for a job again and sometimes he comes home with the smell of whiskey singing all the songs about suffering ireland mam gets angry and says ireland can kiss her arse he says that s nice language to be using in front of the children and she says never mind the language food on the table is what she wants not suffering ireland she says it was a sad day prohibition ended because dad gets the drink going around to saloons offering to sweep out the bars and lift barrels for a whiskey or a beer sometimes he brings home bits of the free lunch rye bread corned beef pickles he puts the food on the table and drinks tea himself he says food is a shock to the system and he doesn t know where we get our appetites mam says they get their appetites because they re starving half the time when dad gets a job mam is cheerful and she sings anyone can see why i wanted your kiss it had to be and the reason is this could it be true someone like you could love me love me when dad brings home the first week s wages mam is delighted she can pay the lovely italian man in the grocery shop and she can hold her head up again because there s nothing worse in the world than to owe and be beholden to anyone she cleans the kitchen washes the mugs and plates brushes crumbs and bits of food from the table cleans out the icebox and orders a fresh block of ice from another italian she buys toilet paper that we can take down the hall to the lavatory and that she says is better than having the headlines from the daily news blackening your arse she boils water on the stove and spends a day at a great tin tub washing our shirts and socks diapers for the twins our two sheets our three towels she hangs everything out on the clotheslines behind the apartment house and we can watch the clothes dance in wind and sun she says you wouldn t want the neighbors to know what you have in the way of a wash but there s nothing like the sweetness of clothes dried by the sun when dad brings home the first week s wages on a friday night we know the weekend will be wonderful on saturday night mam will boil water on the stove and wash us in the great tin tub and dad will dry us malachy will turn around and show his behind dad will pretend to be shocked and we ll all laugh mam will make hot cocoa and we ll be able to stay up while dad tells us a story out of his head all we have to do is say a name mr macadorey or mr leibowitz down the hall and dad will have the two of them rowing up a river in brazil chased by indians with green noses and puce shoulders on nights like that we can drift off to sleep knowing there will be a breakfast of eggs fried tomatoes and fried bread tea with lashings of sugar and milk and later in the day a big dinner of mashed potatoes peas and ham and a trifle mam makes layers of fruit and warm delicious custard on a cake soaked in sherry when dad brings home the first week s wages and the weather is fine mam takes us to the playground she sits on a bench and talks to minnie macadorey she tells minnie stories about characters in limerick and minnie tells her about characters in belfast and they laugh because there are funny people in ireland north and south then they teach each other sad songs and malachy and i leave the swings and see saws to sit with them on the bench and sing a group of young soldiers one night in a camp were talking of sweethearts they had all seemed so merry except one young lad and he was downhearted and sad come and join us said one of the boys surely there s someone for you but ned shook his head and proudly he said i am in love with two each like a mother to me from neither of them shall i part for one is my mother god bless her and love her the other is my sweetheart malachy and i sing that song and mam and minnie laugh till they cry at the way malachy takes a deep bow and holds his arms out to mam at the end dan macadorey comes along on his way home from work and says rudy vallee better start worrying about the competition when we go home mam makes tea and bread and jam or mashed potatoes with butter and salt dad drinks the tea and eats nothing mam says god above how can you work all day and not eat he says the tea is enough she says you ll ruin your health and he tells her again that food is a shock to the system he drinks his tea and tells us stories and shows us letters and words in the daily news or he smokes a cigarette stares at the wall runs his tongue over his lips when dad s job goes into the third week he does not bring home the wages on friday night we wait for him and mam gives us bread and tea the darkness comes down and the lights come on along classon avenue other men with jobs are home already and having eggs for dinner because you can t have meat on a friday you can hear the families talking upstairs and downstairs and down the hall and bing crosby is singing on the radio brother can you spare a dime malachy and i play with the twins we know mam won t sing anyone can see why i wanted your kiss she sits at the kitchen table talking to herself what am i going to do till it s late and dad rolls up the stairs singing roddy mccorley he pushes in the door and calls for us where are my troops where are my four warriors mam says leave those boys alone they re gone to bed half hungry because you have to fill your belly with whiskey he comes to the bedroom door up boys up a nickel for everyone who promises to die for ireland deep in canadian woods we met from one bright island flown great is the land we tread but yet our hearts are with our own up boys up francis malachy oliver eugene the red branch knights the fenian men the ira up up mam is at the kitchen table shaking her hair hanging damp her face wet can t you leave them alone she says jesus mary and joseph isn t it enough that you come home without making fools of the children on top of it she comes to us go back to bed she i want them up he says i want them be free from the center to the sea don t cross me she says for if you your mother s house a penny in your pocket without says ready for the day ireland will do it ll be a sorry day in he pulls his cap down over his face and cries my poor mother poor ireland och what are we going to do mam says you re pure stone mad and she tells us again to go to bed on the morning of the fourth friday of dad s job mam asks him if he ll be home tonight with his wages or will he drink everything again he looks at us and shakes his head at mam as if to say och you shouldn t talk like that in front of the children mam keeps at him i m asking you are you coming home so that we can have a bit of supper or will it be midnight with no money in your pocket and you singing kevin barry and the rest of the sad songs he puts on his cap shoves his hands into his trouser pockets sighs and looks up at the ceiling i told you before i ll be home he says later in the day mam dresses us she puts the twins into the pram and off we go through the long streets of brooklyn sometimes she lets malachy sit in the pram when he s tired of trotting along beside her she tells me i m too big for the pram i could tell her i have pains in my legs from trying to keep up with her but she s not singing and i know this is not the day to be talking about my pains we come to a big gate where there s a man standing in a box with windows all around mam talks to the man she wants to know if she can go inside to where the men are paid and maybe they d give her some of dad s wages so he wouldn t spend it in the bars the man shakes his head i m sorry lady but if we did that we d have half the wives in brooklyn storming the place lotta men have the drinking problem but there s nothing we can do long as they show up sober and do their work we wait across the street mam lets me sit on the sidewalk with my back against the wall she gives the twins their bottles of water and sugar but malachy and i have to wait till she gets money from dad and we can go to the italian for tea and,"['page', 'agent', 'forever', 'nurse', 'uneasy', 'san', 'drop',

on working with kendrick on this trackjust a mere two days after the album s release a ap rocky released fuckin problems which also had help from drake and chainz kendrick gets the honor of having last verse on this track which he states on his first bar yeah ho this the finale my pep talk turn into a pep rallythe rhythmic banger type beat fits kendrick well and he manages to switch up his flow about halfway through keeping you interested with bars like she eyeing me like a nigga don t exist girl i know you want this dick girl i m kendrick lamar a k a benz is to me just a carmemories back then t i ft b o b kendrick lamarlater on after the album s release kendrick was featured on t i s track in december called memories back then with b o b kendrick gives a passionate and poetic verse on a lost young love fitting the theme of the song set to a sample of gotye s somebody that i used to know he tells a classic tale of trying to become a boyfriend to a gold digger with all of his attempts shot down while he raps about her her dreams holds versace she fall for armani only deal with rich niggas fuck you and mitt romneykendrick talked about how he felt when tip asked him to be a feature on the track i ve been listening to him since day one i consider him amongst the elite still to this day along with jay z and nas and people i looked up to coming up for him to actually acknowledge my talents is a great feeling kendrick ends this track with his love interest getting a good dose of karma on her now kendrick being rich and she well fast forward wait is that you with them big old thighs after school and your kids and baby daddies and car note that s overdue collard greens schoolboy q ft kendrick lamarnow kendrick goes into delivering powerful verse after powerful verse but this one with fellow tde label mate black hippy member and good friend schoolboy q stands out the most it was released in june just in time to be in everybody s summer playlists kendrick kills the banger type beat spitting several bars in spanish and q didn t even know what he was saying on his own tracki have no idea what he said and i had no idea he was gonna do that i remember seeing him talking to a spanish dude while he was writing it and he came up with that and i was very upset because he killed it just the first bar let s you know that kendrick is ready to go and on the top of his game and very confident hold up biatch this your favorite songcontrol big sean ft kendrick lamar jay electronicabefore we start off with this track if you haven t heard it which means you must be some mastery of stealth go listen right now you know we had to include this okay kendrick dropped what could very easily be the verse of the track was a cut off of big sean s new album that was released around a month later this verse personally got everybody up and buzzing literally going insane over this verse it dropped at around pm et and people were still up like it was in the afternoon millions of people tweeting kendrick s most memorable bar throughout the song i don t smoke crack motherfucker i sell it ohh yeah and he kinda called out just about every big name rapper saying that he could kill them in the rap game and that they need to step it up i m usually homeboys with the same niggas i m rhymin with but this is hip hop and them niggas should know what time it is and that goes for jermaine cole big krit wale pusha t meek millz a ap rocky drake big sean jay electron tyler mac miller i got love for you all but i m tryna murder you niggas trying to make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas they don t wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggaskendrick fit the beat well going at his absolute best for over minutes showing his case for why he is a cut above the rest of everybody to go with the millions of tweets many artists made responses as they felt hurt and dissed that kendrick would be so braggy and call out all those other rappers no doubt kendrick dropped one of the most powerful and influential verses of the year and this list isn t even over yet big sean spoke about the track which he should be getting very tired of doing when i heard kendrick s verse i was like i m not about to go back and change my verse that s cheating that ain t how g s move i wanted to do that for the culture of hip hop as opposed to myself trying to protect myself when three people hop on a song somebody s gunna have a stand out verse alwaysnosetalgia pusha t ft kendrick lamarwe top this list off with kendrick spitting a passionate verse for friend pusha t about his life and his family s crack addiction and experiences a slow grimy melodic beat makes kendrick s verse feel like a true story kendrick starts off with another bar that people like to repeat you wanna see a dead body that sets the dark tone kendrick takes to tell this tale about his family in something like an outtake or lost track from his very personal debut album he goes everywhere from his brother to his aunt to even his own father even going so far as to curse him out on the track pusha spoke about the track which he did even after control but he explains he asked before that i never heard kendrick talk like that i felt it was really dope that kendrick hopped in my world the street life and put his perspective on it i asked kendrick to get on nosetalgia so long ago and he did push revealed kendrick is a young lyricist in regards to his time in the game and i appreciate it i reached out to him ages ago embed,"['flow', 'push', 'turn', 'drop', 'day',

paperwork into the department of corrections last week again to make sure kynez put my name on his list asked for me specifically out of just three or four people he got room for he already had a last minute day reprieve for him to fantasize on freedom for his lawyers to grasp for straws for reporters to knock on our door for strangers who didn t know him before to hear his name now for the ones of us who do know him to sit in limbo and wait and remember for this giant and monstrous and really real thing that s been an elephant in our dark rooms for eight years to keep its control over our lives and do something not even god can do stop time two days after that i m supposed to get married about that i ain t so sure i didn t plan for the dates to coincide why would i he s supposed to be gone already funeral got to be sped up or put off just cause i m marrying my girl god forbid it all winds up on the same day everybody at my wedding talking about him crying and shit while i m supposed to be dancing and happy and drunk every time my anniversary roll around there s a memory more outstanding than that a chill over it an evil twin to it a hyde am i supposed to carry the flowers from the funeral home and use them at the church for the wedding do we bring all the cakes left over from his repast to my reception hall just in case we run out and need extras i don t know it makes no sense well when i m tired of waiting spencer denetria had badgered after the execution i told her at one time that time was last summer then it became this past winter i would turn up my music bob my head press the headphones deep into my ear drums to jay and pac kanye and common lauryn and mos t i but the initial execution was put off twice a few times and a few months not stayed just appealed twice bullshit new evidence his lawyers claimed now last minute it s been nine years what could they know about now they couldn t know about then how come it took them so long to find out what about all the time he spent in there already who s paying that back what about all the times they told him all of us this shit would all be reversed how many times you think you can get people s hopes up and then go right back to what it was all along people ain t puppets shakes ain t talking he ain t really eating he ain t going out he ain t showering he ain t taking his meds he ain t giving interviews he ain t begging for commissary cash he s writing to us every day sending note after note after note home in perfect cursive one line hieroglyphics the next line a comic strip on the next and illustrations at the end having to do with god and the devil and jesus i don t open mine no more ma dear open hers and mine too she claim they make some sense and she can understand em and i m just not trying hard enough i heard that one before but she ain t my mama she s really his she s just my grandma shakes was born a few months before i was my mother was just in high school with sickle cell anemia and a kentucky fried chicken job and a boyfriend who came by for a while when i was brand new once they graduated he went off to college in the south and married a cheerleader he met on a campus during freaknik so kynez and me raised together all our life are really like brothers ma died when she was i was it s been years since i saw her face outside a picture frame or figment of my imagination i m over it i guess now my life is about looking at shakes pictures with ma dear talking about my daughter with denetria and basically being run around told what to do by everybody serenity s gonna be in pre school next year denetria used to remind me i found a good one off in hammond all the parents i met at the orientation work full time at the casino and the hospital they re married went to college got big pretty rings spencer i don t want my daughter walking up in there the only one without a daddy she got a daddy i reminded denetria my girl my baby mama my fianc who was i a boogieman a leprechaun santa claus dropping off presents a fairy godfather whipping up captain crunch for breakfast and grilled cheese for dinner serenity ain t got no damned daddy news to me i have to watch my words denetria has the apartment not me all my stuff is just there i travel i suppose i m liable to pull up one day and find my shit at the curb where would it go then my woman got the upper hand she remind me of it all the time ma dear s house is down the street from the horseshoe casino on th street same place it s been since i was three my damned self it seem the pink brick one story on the corner the big yard and chain link fence and doghouse in the back and three black dogs running to the front the rottweilers don t bite they just go crazy to get out the fence that s what i tell everybody who ride by or came to get me all these years the pink brick one story on the corner after while it just came known as that this is where we was spencer and shakes one and the same together coming out the house with high top fades lined up fresh crown royal sagging our hoodie pockets a couple blunts stuck in our socks and money clips on the timbos we were popular but that was back then now i realize we should have been paying more attention to more all this magnifies fact i wound up working in the crematorium and incinerator associated with the lake country coroner s office mostly dealing with lake county in indiana but having something or other to do with chicago sometimes the city s downtown is about fifteen miles away since nobody at work knows i know shakes he come on the news and i hear different perspective that nigger crazy let em fry how the fuck did not somebody see that coming we didn t i stay quiet handle the cases and bodies and burials of people who have no next of kin or no money for coffins usually they re people found randomly in motels and hotels and alleys and apartments in big buildings or little houses on unsettled but quiet blocks contrary to what most people think when they hear of a coroner and his office the majority of people i ve ashed to a final grave weren t at all murdered or killed in any violent ways usually it was pretty natural stuff the fact they have to be buried by paid strangers in a coroner s office is usually the most unnatural thing about both how they lived and died though i don t work in the offices i hear they re bodies whose kids haven t seen them in years or whose grandkids forgot their addresses or whose neighbors liked them enough to chit chat close to their doors but not enough to lend money for their headstones a lot of em didn t have a regular doctor to sign the death certificate they come to me rolled in plastic and tarp and bound with twine they ve hardened and shrunk no matter who and what they were when alive they re featureless and faceless and nameless but numbered with a tag on the plastic so we know which slot to put their cardboard box of ashes in down in the cool cellar when it s been a year or two after the person was found but nobody s ever come to claim their ashes we bury the ashes in a communal plot donated by the county and paid for with sales from the deceaseds auctioned estates i wear a fiber filtration mask for the dust and the ashes and the fumes i wear paper booties and a jumpsuit for caution i listen to wgci when i m working with a body and i watch wgn when i get a rest now in days before the sun rise shakes is gonna die the state i work for gets what it want the mothers and fathers and brother and sisters and uncles and aunts and cousins and friends of tina maples get what they want and deserve according to most the white folks who see us every day like gangsters on the news and pass us in strack van till and carson pirie scott and bp amoco and the casino without so much as a kind word or one look in our direction with whatever ideas they keep from seeing us on the news will know they still runnin it they ll know they can run to the woods starting every october with license to shoot down deer who ain t bothering nobody and they can even gloat about it put it on their walls show it off in back of pickups order restored reality checked a grave dug the lord avenged shakes ain t do it he s say that since day one do i believe him do i gotta choice we ve watched him transform babyface grown wrinkled short fade gone dready bird chest gone pumped up wide eyes yellowed he s good behaved but like ma dear says in his movie he always has been nobody been more surprised about his outcome than us yeah we broke curfew we brought girls home when ma dear was at church we called ourselves trying to steal cars joyriding for a bit before parking em right back in the garages of the friends whose parents were never none the wiser that s the stuff i want to think about and remember everything he done dumped on me from inside the bloody fights the tough baloney sandwiches dropping the soap i forgot or at least i try to don t do me no good to remember i don t know why it s a film ma dear can t settle on an outfit she want shakes to see her in for the last time ever i wanna tell her she ain t picking out her dress for easter or the last big birthday party she s ever going to have she s dragged me to dsw and baker s to look for new shoes she still got hope we gonna find high heels with the toe part being wide enough to fit her bunions she got an appointment with miss vera to do her hair the day before so we can check in a motel in michigan city by at least noon the next day and have time to get settled and eat something and then go on to the facility for a visit if we get one then get back in our rooms to stick by the phone until shakes ain t got no more time to call and then go back to the facility least two hours ahead of midnight to make sure all is well and we on time then after he goes to sleep we can get back to the motel to try to get some sleep ourselves in the morning we get to the michigan city medical examiner s office to claim shakes body and bring him back home to us to bury him it s all in divine order ma dear chants over and over and over i swear fore god i ll break a commandment and kill somebody fore i miss it we just going to a funeral and lord knows i been to plenty of those all this is two funerals in a row and the sisters from the church who keep on coming by just nod with her they pray they bring plates covered in aluminum foil cake chicken casseroles dressing she leaves me tupperware on the stove to take to work for lunch denetria found a wedding dress at david s bridal with the back out and no sleeves her tattoos will show the one of her mother and father s names one of my name one of serenity s a loopy downturned aries cross for herself the church is in chicago it s gonna be the same one she was christened and baptized in it s the one serenity s getting baptized in on sunday denetria wants carnations cause they re cheap enough for her to fill the church with but her bouquet gotta be roses she keeps telling me she keeps going to macy s on state street in chicago a couple of times with her girls the hot chicks at the mac counter make up her face in a variety of palettes she checks with me on each one i like none cause they change her face too much i tell her i like all she s gone to another store in macy s for the stationary to print the invitations on the envelopes are purple the information inside is printed in gold on butter cream paper i m supposed to go to david s bridal to get a tux with a purple bowtie and cummerbund sometime before the wedding i m also supposed to notify a best man and a two other groomsmen to match her one sister and best friend from high school when they all walk down the aisle to here and now by luther vandross and gregory hines or always and forever by somebody whose name i just don t know i just go by what i m told i got a mind whose gonna do it but i ain t officially asked them yet i ll do it in a few days i guess after the baptism they got to come get fitted for the same attire i ll wear or at least similar denetria planned all this four months ago around valentine s day soon as i gave her a cluster from zales when we woke up we had had sex it was supposed to be a promise ring but she took it and ran with it for more much in days my brother my twin my dawg my homie my partner my best friend mi amigo my uncle my don my bonnie my clyde my tonto my grandma s son and my mother s brother will be executed he got the first death order a few days after valentine s day when i got engaged all of a sudden we found out about his date the very same day the minute i gave her a ring which denetria had pointed out herself she told me day and time for everything else i had no say about a week later i told her they set the date it s gonna be round that time start of the summer well but ummm i done told everybody bout the wedding already well tell em something else shakes gonna die we gonna have to change it that s tacky i mean i already had serenity damned near three years ago what s one more year or a few more months nigga you just don t want to do it that s all you ain t fooling nobody ain t trying to i switched the record to a song more slow then i took off the headphones best i could do was make love to her and then i could run out to empire chinese for the shrimp fried rice veggie tempura and egg rolls she loves she continued because she had my attention and i would listen i mean it s been almost ten years since all this started i didn t even know you back then you don t even go see him no more i know it s hard trust me i m with you baby i deal with it when you deal with it i m just saying we can t help it now keep our lives on hold you using all this as an excuse she was partially right truth is i didn t much see the need for it i still don t in days the state of indiana will take the one person i ve told more secrets to than her and walk him into a chamber where i m supposed to watch him go to sleep forever like a dog gone sick and never have one more chance to say what s up or how you doin or happy birthday or merry christmas and this is the law this is organized and ordained and practiced this is the way of the land now with rules and randomness like that i don t see how and why my rules of thinking i m enough of a husband and father without all that fanciness isn t enough in my land i am here with my family all the time a phone call text email shout out blackplanet note away i like everybody s shit on facebook i come when i m called to everybody gave up my life for them everybody everything little of it had much to do with me but serenity she s mine that much i admit i don t deny i could have been more responsible i can t blame or scorn her for that the rest of it well i got swept up shakes started smoking weed when we was about he dropped out of school when he was i couldn t i actually liked it i was on the basketball team gym teacher recommended me point guard at calumet c b average it could have been a b if i had tried just a tad bit harder but all that didn t appeal to me i went to classes all week practice after classes kfc on friday and saturday if i didn t have a game church on sundays kfc hired me because they remembered my mother kfc kept me because they remembered my mother i was always late i brought home more than my share of buckets and biscuits got to the point where ma dear and shakes and everybody else depended on me for it then got to the point where shakes wasn t here shakes was in and out for a few years leaving behind a son to boot for ma dear to take care of shakes just had to have a baby by a chick who was worse off into that life than his ass was janice still pop up every now and again after shakes got convicted she dropped their kid off one sunday after church and disappeared for the next two weeks then ma dear said that s it she wouldn t let it out of her sight ever since ma dear sometimes acts mad at me like the boy is mine james ll be a few weeks after the execution he s too young to witness he still remember shakes though with some pride it took me a couple of years to get him off my back like i was his daddy and not his cousin but i guess now after all that s happened and all the talk he understands he s accepted it or at least he pretends to he s in the seventh grade now taller than me and his daddy shakes been locked up whole time he s been in school so the boy hasn t had to explain or talk about it he got his mama s last name perry and not ours madison so nobody associate him with any of it we ve kept it quiet for his own good on y k when everybody i knew had filled up their bathtubs with water and the cabinets with canned goods and the cars with gas and the minds with nonsense shakes was out and about with one or more of the unsavories he brought by the house whom ma dear told him not to bring back i hadn t met denetria yet i was with another chick at the time i remember her name was felicia she kept me plenty occupied for this i was grateful and on y k going to when the folks who had some money was worried about computers losing it and the folks who didn t have money worried about computers messing up government checks me and shakes wasn t worried nothing much was going to change for us either way i just would have been annoyed if the streetlights hadn t worked no more like everybody predicted maybe all the scrambling we were supposed to believe would go on would erase the bills my relatives had run up in my name without paying or all the parking tickets i owed in my own name so for me it was all a good thing stay in the house until everybody else got over the mayhem get used to actually counting out change and saving money in the top drawer again i had a couple grand on me from kfc where i was had been since graduation i never scored more than a on the act so my options were limited i was at calumet college staying warmed up and tight on the lake michigan courts thinking of a transfer but honestly just content where i was why wouldn t i be the pink brick one story house on the corner was paid for the bills minimal the clubs in chicago just thirty minutes away up and down the toll way i could have left it all before the job big mama denetria the name the story i could have been free shakes was into some other stuff i didn t quite know about or understand nor did i want to it was above my head and my means i always been yellow hearted he used to be somebody the ladies who knew me haggled me about where shakes where shakes at call that fine nigga dressed down and up depending on which way you was looking in karl kani fubu rocawear phat farm but he was smoking that weed every day and all day his lips turned black and thin like purple play doh rolled out he lost a tooth by time he was going on nineteen he was on his way to two years in cook county boot camp for an east chicago corner store robbery where he drove the car but didn t have the pistol so he was spared the real deal boot camp waiting list was so long he got out early a few weeks or months i don t remember all this shit exact then by time he was twenty he started to wear the same outfits a few days in a row and wipe off pools of sweat whenever he showed up to sit with me on the porch to see the dogs for a bit they still recognized him easy i didn t he shook he drooled he rambled he stunk of not enough deodorant but too much cologne he laughed crazy he was on that shit you need to get on out of ma dear s house he always told me his head stood an inch taller than mine even when we sat down on the porch his biceps pumped out of a dingy and torn muscle shirt like he was the one shooting layups as if he once thought his life depended on it i had on a down jacket he claimed he wasn t even cold i m good i had told him he wiped his nose with his bare forearm he didn t even mind the snowflakes come down on the mouth of the sunkist i suspected as his only meal before he appeared in the kitchen to devour all our bacon and eggs then he took a few video games he claimed he would bring right back and ran all the hot water out the shower so ma bitched later on she couldn t wash any white clothes until the night and about two weeks after that last time we sat on the porch when we threw off a whole pack of raw bacon to the dogs knowin ma dear would hit the roof so we laughed in advance at her reaction when i shivered in my down jacket and shakes sweat in his bare arms the weather turned a bit friendlier the snow thawed on the indiana dunes near a stone quarry a salt worker saw tina maples body with part of her face blasted off but her once pregnant belly intact preserved in the snow like she had expected to come back after somebody forced her from a day at the mall to withdraw cash from a remote atm where brown and gray faces were recorded and one of them looked like shakes just a little bit some five years ago in winter a white man who claimed he wasn t white i m jewish showed up at the pink one story brick house on the corner he brought a book with his name on the front and picture on the back to show us ma was impressed now this wasn t about us it was about our neighbor state of illinois they had a governor sweet enough to commute a life back to everybody on death row over there damn if we could have just lived across indianapolis boulevard at the fringe of chicago shakes would have been one of them so this set other folks off to rebel and rally all of america to let capital punishment go robert and jessica lepavsky were the producers and directors of a movie of this husband and wife they mean well i guess got our information from shakes who gave it to his lawyers to pass robert lepavsky and his people don t look too different to me from the coaches who sat on ricky s raggedy couch in boyz in the hood knowing the boy could barely read but they wanted him to make their schools into football champions regardless same thing here shakes had always been spoiled he could turn ma dear on with a look or a plea like it wasn t nothing and according to himself he wanted robert lepavsky lepavsky s assistants and this documentary film company to tell his story for the whole world to know from here on out and ma dear was just gonna have to go along with that just cause i knew somebody sitting in a six by nine jail cell on count of it i didn t have nothing to do with the decision to be part of no movies about the death penalty had i had something to do with it somebody would have been paying me and anybody else on camera we would ve had some royalties or something coming back here for it if hollywood had been my calling this ain t the movie i would have auditioned for even if i d been into making porn which i m shamed to admit i have kinda sorta done just privately with willing subjects i would ve gotten paid some real good money for it the film crew is a bunch of people who all have jobs in the colleges in chicago where nobody i know can even get into i never say too much to the crew thankfully and respectfully only a few people robert comes with a bundle of two or three people to run a camera and lights and a microphone an hour maybe two gonna be compressed out of all these hundreds of hours of film they pushed out of our lives of course the most ridiculous or emotional or upsetting times gonna make the cut like a reality t v show we really are just normal people we work sleep talk eat watch television play spades get drunk get high drive around ordinary shit though the majority of the time is caught up with this big thing dumped in our lives nobody is gonna say it or talk about it we can t do anything about it so why should we talk about it and some things just private i wasn t about to explain the nightmares i been having since all this started and not the ones you know are nightmares even when you sleep it s something to be said for dreaming about a place you never seen or been with a cast full of faces you can t recognize it s a little bit of control in that situation like watching a scary movie in the theatre with your friends but letting yourself be scared for fun but when you sleep and there s giant horses right in the same kitchen you just made a sandwich in or headless bodies on the same lawn your bedroom window faces or an impression of somebody you just talked to that day sketched in the trees by your house it s harder to call it a dream in the moment the time span between what you did and what you dreamed is too short not to wonder what you might have missed the first time those the conditions under which i signed a waiver to be included in shakes movie just by default and for documentation i was half asleep i wish i hadn t signed everybody else got excited about it made the best of it it s better than getting your ass kicked and weave tore out and relationship shattered on jerry springer just to be on television i suppose they thought my problem with the whole situation was the lack of reverence i mean if i was going into somebody s house and jail cell since technically that s somebody s house i would be somber and over courteous i m not saying robert and jessica aren t anyone they bring around is grade a classy people but they all just seem a little bit too energetic and overeager given the context of the situation when their cameras stop rolling we keep going despite ordinary shit for us every single day i ain t bout to stop my life right along with it ma dear said when it came up and it was just a front because her life stopped to doing nothing but talking bout shakes iii sodium thiopental will put shakes to sleep make him unconscious basically like he s about to get his teeth or appendix pulled out we re just gonna wave we discussed pancuronium bromide will stop his breathing but since he s sleep he won t know he s not taking any breaths that s the second shot potassium chloride breaks his heart he ll get that shot last and that s it when my baby was born january i was years old and unhappy working at kentucky fried chicken it was getting embarrassing to be a nearly six foot tall man with a six pack but wearing an apron and bonnet to work i only made barely dollars an hour the only glory in it was i could say i had become a supervisor this humiliation was especially since my woman was a retail manager at carson pirie scott in the juniors and lingerie sections she brought home sexy dresses and lace underwear and designer baby clothes i brought home fried chicken it didn t match up i felt least i could do was bring home a decent paycheck with some real benefits health insurance life insurance savings for my babies by this time everybody was starting to look for jobs online i didn t have the internet at home yet libraries always been too quiet for me i went to the back of a few papers and saw information about the oil fields stockyards kirby vacuum cleaner sales chicago bridge operators the coroner s office was hiring this was the government i thought it would be more stable give me more days off and sound more prestigious i went to the office in crown point for a group interview with about eight other people mostly men and one mexican woman when they asked what qualified us for the position i talked about being used to handling animal parts in high heat for whatever reason i wasn t called back i called the office a few times over the next month to find out when they would be looking for people again i was told that was it for the year but one day i got to the pink brick one story on the corner and there was a message for me on the machine i was invited in for another interview then i was sent to a doctor s office in crown point to do a drop i stopped smoking weed on the september morning shakes was convicted so it was clear i was hired a few days later and in a paid orientation by the next week after a few months of checks i was able to book for me and denetria to go on an apple vacation to jamaica for a holiday after a year of checks i could pay for half her rent and a brand new dodge saturn for myself after two years of checks i decided to go to school for business and mortuary science degrees if i took a little more time to save i could keep student loans out of my hair i always regret i never gave proper notice to my manager at kfc mystery harris worked with my mother at the same kfc back when they were in high school of course since it was only a few miles away and we had gotten hooked on it over all these years me quitting didn t stop us from going through the drive through the people i knew and worked with always seemed to wait on denetria and ma dear when i wasn t around whenever i went up there i got the new faces silly young girls who gossiped while they took my order they seemed to be mean ugly people who never said thanks i knew mystery worked the morning shift on saturdays she was old enough not to care about going out no more and all the teenagers who worked there still needed their friday nights i don t know why it hit me one day but i wanted to go see her ever since the date was set for shakes i hadn t been able to get to sleep or stay there i get up like this again on saturday early i let the dogs out to do their business i let them back in i watch an auditorium church service on television i heat up a frozen pack of pancakes eggs and sausages i drink all the orange juice i play with myself like i usually do after a few nights of staying away from denetria s at the pink brick one story on the corner with ma dear instead i watch some cartoons i wash the dishes by the time ma dear is unlocking her,"['forever', 'asleep', 'dog', 'trust', 'drop', 'brown',

lyrics it was about the beginning of september that i among the rest of my neighbours heard in ordinary discourse that the plague was returned again in holland for it had been very violent there and particularly at amsterdam and rotterdam in the year whither they say it was brought some said from italy others from the levant among some goods which were brought home by their turkey fleet others said it was brought from candia others from cyprus it mattered not from whence it came but all agreed it was come into holland again we had no such thing as printed newspapers in those days to spread rumours and reports of things and to improve them by the invention of men as i have lived to see practised since but such things as these were gathered from the letters of merchants and others who corresponded abroad and from them was handed about by word of mouth only so that things did not spread instantly over the whole nation as they do now but it seems that the government had a true account of it and several councils were held about ways to prevent its coming over but all was kept very private hence it was that this rumour died off again and people began to forget it as a thing we were very little concerned in and that we hoped was not true till the latter end of november or the beginning of december when two men said to be frenchmen died of the plague in long acre or rather at the upper end of drury lane the family they were in endeavoured to conceal it as much as possible but as it had gotten some vent in the discourse of the neighbourhood the secretaries of state got knowledge of it and concerning themselves to inquire about it in order to be certain of the truth two physicians and a surgeon were ordered to go to the house and make inspection this they did and finding evident tokens of the sickness upon both the bodies that were dead they gave their opinions publicly that they died of the plague whereupon it was given in to the parish clerk and he also returned them to the hall and it was printed in the weekly bill of mortality in the usual manner thus plague parishes infected the people showed a great concern at this and began to be alarmed all over the town and the more because in the last week in december another man died in the same house and of the same distemper and then we were easy again for about six weeks when none having died with any marks of infection it was said the distemper was gone but after that i think it was about the th of february another died in another house but in the same parish and in the same manner this turned the people s eyes pretty much towards that end of the town and the weekly bills showing an increase of burials in st giles s parish more than usual it began to be suspected that the plague was among the people at that end of the town and that many had died of it though they had taken care to keep it as much from the knowledge of the public as possible this possessed the heads of the people very much and few cared to go through drury lane or the other streets suspected unless they had extraordinary business that obliged them to it this increase of the bills stood thus the usual number of burials in a week in the parishes of st giles in the fields and st andrew s holborn were from twelve to seventeen or nineteen each few more or less but from the time that the plague first began in st giles s parish it was observed that the ordinary burials increased in number considerably for example from december to january st giles s st andrew s january st giles s st andrew s january st giles s st andrew s january st giles s st andrew s january st giles s st andrew s january february st giles s st andrew s february st giles s the like increase of the bills was observed in the parishes of st bride s adjoining on one side of holborn parish and in the parish of st james clerkenwell adjoining on the other side of holborn in both which parishes the usual numbers that died weekly were from four to six or eight whereas at that time they were increased as follows from december to december st bride s st james s december to january st bride s st james s january st bride s st james s january st bride s st james s january st bride s st james s january st bride s st james s january february st bride s st james s february st bride s st james s besides this it was observed with great uneasiness by the people that the weekly bills in general increased very much during these weeks although it was at a time of the year when usually the bills are very moderate the usual number of burials within the bills of mortality for a week was from about or thereabouts to the last was esteemed a pretty high bill but after this we found the bills successively increasing as follows buried increased december the th to the th th rd january january the rd th th th th th this last bill was really frightful being a higher number than had been known to have been buried in one week since the preceding visitation of however all this went off again and the weather proving cold and the frost which began in december still continuing very severe even till near the end of february attended with sharp though moderate winds the bills decreased again and the city grew healthy and everybody began to look upon the danger as good as over only that still the burials in st giles s continued high from the beginning of april especially they stood at twenty five each week till the week from the th to the th when there was buried in st giles s parish thirty whereof two of the plague and eight of the spotted fever which was looked upon as the same thing likewise the number that died of the spotted fever in the whole increased being eight the week before and twelve the week above named this alarmed us all again and terrible apprehensions were among the people especially the weather being now changed and growing warm and the summer being at hand however the next week there seemed to be some hopes again the bills were low the number of the dead in all was but there was none of the plague and but four of the spotted fever but the following week it returned again and the distemper was spread into two or three other parishes viz st andrew s holborn st clement danes and to the great affliction of the city one died within the walls in the parish of st mary woolchurch that is to say in bearbinder lane near stocks market in all there were nine of the plague and six of the spotted fever it was however upon inquiry found that this frenchman who died in bearbinder lane was one who having lived in long acre near the infected houses had removed for fear of the distemper not knowing that he was already infected this was the beginning of may yet the weather was temperate variable and cool enough and people had still some hopes that which encouraged them was that the city was healthy the whole ninety seven parishes buried but fifty four and we began to hope that as it was chiefly among the people at that end of the town it might go no farther and the rather because the next week which was from the th of may to the th there died but three of which not one within the whole city or liberties and st andrew s buried but fifteen which was very low tis true st giles s buried two and thirty but still as there was but one of the plague people began to be easy the whole bill also was very low for the week before the bill was but and the week above mentioned but we continued in these hopes for a few days but it was but for a few for the people were no more to be deceived thus they searched the houses and found that the plague was really spread every way and that many died of it every day so that now all our extenuations abated and it was no more to be concealed nay it quickly appeared that the infection had spread itself beyond all hopes of abatement that in the parish of st giles it was gotten into several streets and several families lay all sick together and accordingly in the weekly bill for the next week the thing began to show itself there was indeed but fourteen set down of the plague but this was all knavery and collusion for in st giles s parish they buried forty in all whereof it was certain most of them died of the plague though they were set down of other distempers and though the number of all the burials were not increased above thirty two and the whole bill being but yet there was fourteen of the spotted fever as well as fourteen of the plague and we took it for granted upon the whole that there were fifty died that week of the plague the next bill was from the rd of may to the th when the number of the plague was seventeen but the burials in st giles s were fifty three a frightful number of whom they set down but nine of the plague but on an examination more strictly by the justices of peace and at the lord mayor s request it was found there were twenty more who were really dead of the plague in that parish but had been set down of the spotted fever or other distempers besides others concealed but those were trifling things to what followed immediately after for now the weather set in hot and from the first week in june the infection spread in a dreadful manner and the bills rose high the articles of the fever spotted fever and teeth began to swell for all that could conceal their distempers did it to prevent their neighbours shunning and refusing to converse with them and also to prevent authority shutting up their houses which though it was not yet practised yet was threatened and people were extremely terrified at the thoughts of it the second week in june the parish of st giles where still the weight of the infection lay buried whereof though the bills said but sixty eight of the plague everybody said there had been at least calculating it from the usual number of funerals in that parish as above till this week the city continued free there having never any died except that one frenchman whom i mentioned before within the whole ninety seven parishes now there died four within the city one in wood street one in fenchurch street and two in crooked lane southwark was entirely free having not one yet died on that side of the water i lived without aldgate about midway between aldgate church and whitechappel bars on the left hand or north side of the street and as the distemper had not reached to that side of the city our neighbourhood continued very easy but at the other end of the town their consternation was very great and the richer sort of people especially the nobility and gentry from the west part of the city thronged out of town with their families and servants in an unusual manner and this was more particularly seen in whitechappel that is to say the broad street where i lived indeed nothing was to be seen but waggons and carts with goods women servants children c coaches filled with people of the better sort and horsemen attending them and all hurrying away then empty waggons and carts appeared and spare horses with servants who it was apparent were returning or sent from the countries to fetch more people besides innumerable numbers of men on horseback some alone others with servants and generally speaking all loaded with baggage and fitted out for travelling as anyone might perceive by their appearance this was a very terrible and melancholy thing to see and as it was a sight which i could not but look on from morning to night for indeed there was nothing else of moment to be seen it filled me with very serious thoughts of the misery that was coming upon the city and the unhappy condition of those that would be left in it this hurry of the people was such for some weeks that there was no getting at the lord mayor s door without exceeding difficulty there were such pressing and crowding there to get passes and certificates of health for such as travelled abroad for without these there was no being admitted to pass through the towns upon the road or to lodge in any inn now as there had none died in the city for all this time my lord mayor gave certificates of health without any difficulty to all those who lived in the ninety seven parishes and to those within the liberties too for a while this hurry i say continued some weeks that is to say all the month of may and june and the more because it was rumoured that an order of the government was to be issued out to place turnpikes and barriers on the road to prevent people travelling and that the towns on the road would not suffer people from london to pass for fear of bringing the infection along with them though neither of these rumours had any foundation but in the imagination especially at first i now began to consider seriously with myself concerning my own case and how i should dispose of myself that is to say whether i should resolve to stay in london or shut up my house and flee as many of my neighbours did i have set this particular down so fully because i know not but it may be of moment to those who come after me if they come to be brought to the same distress and to the same manner of making their choice and therefore i desire this account may pass with them rather for a direction to themselves to act by than a history of my actings seeing it may not be of one farthing value to them to note what became of me i had two important things before me the one was the carrying on my business and shop which was considerable and in which was embarked all my effects in the world and the other was the preservation of my life in so dismal a calamity as i saw apparently was coming upon the whole city and which however great it was my fears perhaps as well as other people s represented to be much greater than it could be the first consideration was of great moment to me my trade was a saddler and as my dealings were chiefly not by a shop or chance trade but among the merchants trading to the english colonies in america so my effects lay very much in the hands of such i was a single man tis true but i had a family of servants whom i kept at my business had a house shop and warehouses filled with goods and in short to leave them all as things in such a case must be left that is to say without any overseer or person fit to be trusted with them had been to hazard the loss not only of my trade but of my goods and indeed of all i had in the world i had an elder brother at the same time in london and not many years before come over from portugal and advising with him his answer was in three words the same that was given in another case quite different viz master save thyself in a word he was for my retiring into the country as he resolved to do himself with his family telling me what he had it seems heard abroad that the best preparation for the plague was to run away from it as to my argument of losing my trade my goods or debts he quite confuted me he told me the same thing which i argued for my staying viz that i would trust god with my safety and health was the strongest repulse to my pretensions of losing my trade and my goods for says he is it not as reasonable that you should trust god with the chance or risk of losing your trade as that you should stay in so eminent a point of danger and trust him with your life i could not argue that i was in any strait as to a place where to go having several friends and relations in northamptonshire whence our family first came from and particularly i had an only sister in lincolnshire very willing to receive and entertain me my brother who had already sent his wife and two children into bedfordshire and resolved to follow them pressed my going very earnestly and i had once resolved to comply with his desires but at that time could get no horse for though it is true all the people did not go out of the city of london yet i may venture to say that in a manner all the horses did for there was hardly a horse to be bought or hired in the whole city for some weeks once i resolved to travel on foot with one servant and as many did lie at no inn but carry a soldier s tent with us and so lie in the fields the weather being very warm and no danger from taking cold i say as many did because several did so at last especially those who had been in the armies in the war which had not been many years past and i must needs say that speaking of second causes had most of the people that travelled done so the plague had not been carried into so many country towns and houses as it was to the great damage and indeed to the ruin of abundance of people but then my servant whom i had intended to take down with me deceived me and being frighted at the increase of the distemper and not knowing when i should go he took other measures and left me so i was put off for that time and one way or other i always found that to appoint to go away was always crossed by some accident or other so as to disappoint and put it off again and this brings in a story which otherwise might be thought a needless digression viz about these disappointments being from heaven i mention this story also as the best method i can advise any person to take in such a case especially if he be one that makes conscience of his duty and would be directed what to do in it namely that he should keep his eye upon the particular providences which occur at that time and look upon them complexly as they regard one another and as all together regard the question before him and then i think he may safely take them for intimations from heaven of what is his unquestioned duty to do in such a case i mean as to going away from or staying in the place where we dwell when visited with an infectious distemper it came very warmly into my mind one morning as i was musing on this particular thing that as nothing attended us without the direction or permission of divine power so these disappointments must have something in them extraordinary and i ought to consider whether it did not evidently point out or intimate to me that it was the will of heaven i should not go it immediately followed in my thoughts that if it really was from god that i should stay he was able effectually to preserve me in the midst of all the death and danger that would surround me and that if i attempted to secure myself by fleeing from my habitation and acted contrary to these intimations which i believe to be divine it was a kind of flying from god and that he could cause his justice to overtake me when and where he thought fit these thoughts quite turned my resolutions again and when i came to discourse with my brother again i told him that i inclined to stay and take my lot in that station in which god had placed me and that it seemed to be made more especially my duty on the account of what i have said my brother though a very religious man himself laughed at all i had suggested about its being an intimation from heaven and told me several stories of such foolhardy people as he called them as i was that i ought indeed to submit to it as a work of heaven if i had been any way disabled by distempers or diseases and that then not being able to go i ought to acquiesce in the direction of him who having been my maker had an undisputed right of sovereignty in disposing of me and that then there had been no difficulty to determine which was the call of his providence and which was not but that i should take it as an intimation from heaven that i should not go out of town only because i could not hire a horse to go or my fellow was run away that was to attend me was ridiculous since at the time i had my health and limbs and other servants and might with ease travel a day or two on foot and having a good certificate of being in perfect health might either hire a horse or take post on the road as i thought fit then he proceeded to tell me of the mischievous consequences which attended the presumption of the turks and mahometans in asia and in other places where he had been for my brother being a merchant was a few years before as i have already observed returned from abroad coming last from lisbon and how presuming upon their professed predestinating notions and of every man s end being predetermined and unalterably beforehand decreed they would go unconcerned into infected places and converse with infected persons by which means they died at the rate of ten or fifteen thousand a week whereas the europeans or christian merchants who kept themselves retired and reserved generally escaped the contagion upon these arguments my brother changed my resolutions again and i began to resolve to go and accordingly made all things ready for in short the infection increased round me and the bills were risen to almost seven hundred a week and my brother told me he would venture to stay no longer i desired him to let me consider of it but till the next day and i would resolve and as i had already prepared everything as well as i could as to my business and whom to entrust my affairs with i had little to do but to resolve i went home that evening greatly oppressed in my mind irresolute and not knowing what to do i had set the evening wholly apart to consider seriously about it and was all alone for already people had as it were by a general consent taken up the custom of not going out of doors after sunset the reasons i shall have occasion to say more of by and by in the retirement of this evening i endeavoured to resolve first what was my duty to do and i stated the arguments with which my brother had pressed me to go into the country and i set against them the strong impressions which i had on my mind for staying the visible call i seemed to have from the particular circumstance of my calling and the care due from me for the preservation of my effects which were as i might say my estate also the intimations which i thought i had from heaven that to me signified a kind of direction to venture and it occurred to me that if i had what i might call a direction to stay i ought to suppose it contained a promise of being preserved if i obeyed this lay close to me and my mind seemed more and more encouraged to stay than ever and supported with a secret satisfaction that i should be kept add to this that turning over the bible which lay before me and while my thoughts were more than ordinarily serious upon the question i cried out well i know not what to do lord direct me i and the like and at that juncture i happened to stop turning over the book at the gist psalm and casting my eye on the second verse i read on to the seventh verse exclusive and after that included the tenth as follows i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will i trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou hast made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling c i scarce need tell the reader that from that moment i resolved that i would stay in the town and casting myself entirely upon the goodness and protection of the almighty would not seek any other shelter whatever and that as my times were in his hands he was as able to keep me in a time of the infection as in a time of health and if he did not think fit to deliver me still i was in his hands and it was meet he should do with me as should seem good to him with this resolution i went to bed and i was further confirmed in it the next day by the woman being taken ill with whom i had intended to entrust my house and all my affairs but i had a further obligation laid on me on the same side for the next day i found myself very much out of order also so that if i would have gone away i could not and i continued ill three or four days and this entirely determined my stay so i took my leave of my brother who went away to dorking in surrey and afterwards fetched a round farther into buckinghamshire or bedfordshire to a retreat he had found out there for his family it was a very ill time to be sick in for if any one complained it was immediately said he had the plague and though i had indeed no symptom of that distemper yet being very ill both in my head and in my stomach i was not without apprehension that i really was infected but in about three days i grew better the third night i rested well sweated a little and was much refreshed the apprehensions of its being the infection went also quite away with my illness and i went about my business as usual these things however put off all my thoughts of going into the country and my brother also being gone i had no more debate either with him or with myself on that subject it was now mid july and the plague which had chiefly raged at the other end of the town and as i said before in the parishes of st giles st andrew s holborn and towards westminster began to now come eastward towards the part where i lived it was to be observed indeed that it did not come straight on towards us for the city that is to say within the walls was indifferently healthy still nor was it got then very much over the water into southwark for though there died that week of all distempers whereof it might be supposed above died of the plague yet there was but twenty eight in the whole city within the walls and but nineteen in southwark lambeth parish included whereas in the parishes of st giles and st martin in the fields alone there died but we perceived the infection kept chiefly in the out parishes which being very populous and fuller also of poor the distemper found more to prey upon than in the city as i shall observe afterwards we perceived i say the distemper to draw our way viz by the parishes of clarkenwell cripplegate shoreditch and bishopsgate which last two parishes joining to aldgate whitechappel and stepney the infection came at length to spread its utmost rage and violence in those parts even when it abated at the western parishes where it began it was very strange to observe that in this particular week from the th to the th of july when as i have observed there died near of the plague in the two parishes of st martin and st giles in the fields only there died in the parish of aldgate but four in the parish of whitechappel three in the parish of stepney but one likewise in the next week from the th of july to the th when the week s bill was yet there died no more of the plague on the whole southwark side of the water than sixteen but this face of things soon changed and it began to thicken in cripplegate parish especially and in clarkenwell so that by the second week in august cripplegate parish alone buried and clarkenwell of the first might well be reckoned to die of the plague and of the last the bill itself said were of the plague during the month of july and while as i have observed our part of the town seemed to be spared in comparison of the west part i went ordinarily about the streets as my business required and particularly went generally once in a day or in two days into the city to my brother s house which he had given me charge of and to see if it was safe and having the key in my pocket i used to go into the house and over most of the rooms to see that all was well for though it be something wonderful to tell that any should have hearts so hardened in the midst of such a calamity as to rob and steal yet certain it is that all sorts of villainies and even levities and debaucheries were then practised in the town as openly as ever i will not say quite as frequently because the numbers of people were many ways lessened but the city itself began now to be visited too i mean within the walls but the number of people there were indeed extremely lessened by so great a multitude having been gone into the country and even all this month of july they continued to flee though not in such multitudes as formerly in august indeed they fled in such a manner that i began to think there would be really none but magistrates and servants left in the city as they fled now out of the city so i should observe that the court removed early viz in the month of june and went to oxford where it pleased god to preserve them and the distemper did not as i heard of so much as touch them for which i cannot say that i ever saw they showed any great token of thankfulness and hardly anything of reformation though they did not want being told that their crying vices might without breach of charity be said to have gone far in bringing that terrible judgement upon the whole nation the face of london was now indeed strangely altered i mean the whole mass of buildings city liberties suburbs westminster southwark and altogether for as to the particular part called the city or within the walls that was not yet much infected but in the whole the face of things i say was much altered sorrow and sadness sat upon every face and though some parts were not yet overwhelmed yet all looked deeply concerned and as we saw it apparently coming on so every one looked on himself and his family as in the utmost danger were it possible to represent those times exactly to those that did not see them and give the reader due ideas of the horror that everywhere presented itself it must make just impressions upon their minds and fill them with surprise london might well be said to be all in tears the mourners did not go about the streets indeed for nobody put on black or made a formal dress of mourning for their nearest friends but the voice of mourners was truly heard in the streets the shrieks of women and children at the windows and doors of their houses where their dearest relations were perhaps dying or just dead were so frequent to be heard as we passed the streets that it was enough to pierce the stoutest heart in the world to hear them tears and lamentations were seen almost in every house especially in the first part of the visitation for towards the latter end men s hearts were hardened and death was so always before their eyes that they did not so much concern themselves for the loss of their friends expecting that themselves should be summoned the next hour business led me out sometimes to the other end of the town even when the sickness was chiefly there and as the thing was new to me as well as to everybody else it was a most surprising thing to see those streets which were usually so thronged now grown desolate and so few people to be seen in them that if i had been a stranger and at a loss for my way i might sometimes have gone the length of a whole street i mean of the by streets and seen nobody to direct me except watchmen set at the doors of such houses as were shut up of which i shall speak presently one day being at that part of the town on some special business curiosity led me to observe things more than usually and indeed i walked a great way where i had no business i went up holborn and there the street was full of people but they walked in the middle of the great street neither on one side or other because as i suppose they would not mingle with anybody that came out of houses or meet with smells and scent from houses that might be infected the inns of court were all shut up nor were very many of the lawyers in the temple or lincoln s inn or gray s inn to be seen there everybody was at peace there was no occasion for lawyers besides it being in the time of the vacation too they were generally gone into the country whole rows of houses in some places were shut close up the inhabitants all fled and only a watchman or two left when i speak of rows of houses being shut up i do not mean shut up by the magistrates but that great numbers of persons followed the court by the necessity of their employments and other dependences and as others retired really frighted with the distemper it was a mere desolating of some of the streets but the fright was not yet near so great in the city abstractly so called and particularly because though they were at first in a most inexpressible consternation yet as i have observed that the distemper intermitted often at first so they were as it were alarmed and unalarmed again and this several times till it began to be familiar to them and that even when it appeared violent yet seeing it did not presently spread into the city or the east and south parts the people began to tak,"['trust', 'laugh',

en la causa seguida por el atentado contra la sede de la amia con el objeto de que eludan definitivamente a la justicia argentina y se sustraigan de ella se ver tambi n que para la poca en que se urdi e instrument el plan criminal la urgencia energ tica que atravesaba y atraviesa nuestro pa s y el anhelo por restablecer plenas relaciones comerciales a nivel estatal ligados a una visi n geopol tica de acercamiento con la rep blica isl mica de ir n fueron seg n las pruebas con que se cuenta los factores determinantes para que la primera mandataria dra cristina elisabet fern ndez con la necesaria e inestimable participaci n y colaboraci n de h ctor timerman tomara la aciaga decisi n de llevar adelante este plan de impunidad sacrificando la justicia en el caso amia en efecto quedar acreditado que esta confabulaci n criminal fue decidida por la sra presidente de la naci n y puesta en funcionamiento principalmente por su ministro de relaciones exteriores y culto h ctor marcos timerman asimismo se probar la activa participaci n criminal de terceros en la maniobra entre los que cabe mencionar a luis ngel d el a a jorge alejandro yussuf khalil al diputado nacional andr s larroque a fernando esteche al ex fiscal designado para actuar en forma conjunta alterna o sucesiva en la causa amia h ctor luis yrimia y a un individuo perteneciente a la secretar a de inteligencia de presidencia de la naci n identificado como alian que seg n las constancias halladas todo indica que se tratar a de ram n alian h ctor bogado en ese sentido se presentar n las pruebas que ilustran que el plan que aqu se denuncia incluy negociaciones secretas y p blicas con los iran es durante las cuales se acord dar de baja las notificaciones rojas de interpol y que dichas tratativas desembocaron en la firma de un memorando de entendimiento que en su esencia debe ser considerado como lo que realmente es apenas uno de los medios elegidos por los aqu acusados para garantizar lo que se hab a acordado de antemano esto es la impunidad de los pr fugos iran es y su desvinculaci n definitiva de la causa como se ver en detalle durante el desarrollo de la denuncia y se adelantar unos p rrafos m s abajo la firma y ratificaci n de tal documento implica lisa y llanamente la destrucci n de las imputaciones contra los acusados de nacionalidad iran en primer lugar porque las conclusiones de la llamada comisi n de la verdad como as lo revela la evidencia ya se encontraban previamente arregladas entre los signatarios en segunda medida como se verific en los hechos debido a que el acuerdo fue la excusa que esgrimieron las partes para solicitar a interpol que diera de baja las notificaciones rojas en tercer t rmino porque su confusa y ambigua redacci n y las innumerables fases sucesivas previstas sin plazo alguno para que sus disposiciones sean aplicadas permite que los socios en este acuerdo de impunidad aludan indefinidamente a la existencia del memorando aunque en la pr ctica no produzca efecto legal alguno tambi n se probar que el plan de impunidad perge ado por la sra presidente de la naci n incluy un cambio de hip tesis y un redireccionamiento de la investigaci n judicial del caso amia hacia nuevos imputados fundado en pruebas falsas y destinado a desvincular definitiva y fraudulentamente a los acusados iran es de hecho algunos de los aqu acusados estuvieron expresamente abocados a fabricar esta hip tesis falsa sab an que la comisi n de la verdad no hab a sido creada para investigar absolutamente nada sino para legitimar la mentira que se estaba fabricando se acreditar que este plan criminal tambi n involucr acuerdos secretos por fuera del memorando de entendimiento as se concert en forma oculta el cese de las notificaciones rojas de interpol que pesaban y pesan sobre los funcionarios iran es por ser el inter s cardinal de teher n para suscribir el acuerdo asimismo se probar que secretamente se hab a pactado que en la pr ctica el ex ministro de defensa iran y actual pr fugo de la justicia argentina ahmad vahidi jam s ser a interrogado a pesar de lo estipulado en el memorando pues as hab a sido convenido entre las partes ya hab a sido conversado antes adem s quedar evidenciado que los funcionarios involucrados en este plan criminal ya sean argentinos o iran es han tenido un objetivo com n que no se trata de dos partes negociando un acuerdo como se lo quiso presentar p blicamente sino de dos socios buscando borrar sin que nadie lo advierta una imputaci n penal en un delito de lesa humanidad m s a n aqu se demostrar que los pasos y avances del plan criminal fueron comunicados en tiempo real no solo a las autoridades iran es sino tambi n a uno de los pr fugos de la causa amia mohsen rabbani quien particip de negociaciones comerciales con las autoridades argentinas involucradas en este plan e intervino en las tratativas dirigidas fundamentalmente a garantizar su propia impunidad tambi n quedar evidenciado que se lanz una feroz campa a de descr dito hacia la investigaci n del caso destinada a horadar la versi n judicial de los hechos y se la combin con una campa a de enga o compuesta por falacias puestas en escena mentiras desmentidas falsas promesas y la manipulaci n a sobrevivientes y familiares de las v ctimas del atentado a fin de evitar que la opini n p blica conozca la entidad del verdadero objetivo encubridor oculto detr s del memorando de entendimiento firmado con ir n asimismo se expondr n los elementos de prueba que acreditan que la sra presidente y el sr canciller efectuaron aportes en la necesaria divisi n de tareas que implic esta compleja maniobra delictiva de las contribuciones concretas y espec ficas de la sra presidente que se han podido acreditar con s lido sustento probatorio surge con claridad que no solamente fue quien decidi la articulaci n de este plan criminal de impunidad sino que para ello se vali de distintos actores para llevar adelante su ejecuci n y en todo momento estuvo en control de la misma ya sea impartiendo rdenes directas a sus c mplices o bien encabezando la campa a discursiva y medi tica necesaria para camuflar la perpetraci n del delito as ha elegido a algunos de los part cipes de la maniobra delictiva involucrando directamente a cuanto menos uno de sus ministros y a un legislador nacional ha controlado la evoluci n del plan en cada paso ha negociado por interp sitas personas con uno de los pr fugos y se ha involucrado personalmente en algunas acciones de ocultamiento que este sofisticado plan requer a en la misma l nea se demostrar holgadamente que el ministro de relaciones exteriores y culto de la naci n h ctor timerman ha sido sin duda alguna el principal instrumentador del plan de impunidad ideado y ordenado por la sra presidente dra cristina fern ndez naturalmente trat ndose de un plan criminal que ha involucrado a un pa s extranjero el canciller ocupaba y ocupa el puesto clave para encargarse personalmente de muchos aspectos de este encubrimiento desde su funci n transmiti a ir n la decisi n del gobierno argentino de abandonar el reclamo de justicia en la causa amia acord la baja de las notificaciones rojas sign acuerdos secretos con la parte iran particip de las negociaciones de la redacci n y de la firma del memorando de entendimiento pieza central del plan de impunidad y se involucr personalmente en la campa a de descr dito y enga o destinada a destruir la credibilidad de la causa judicial con el fin de dolosamente presentar al acuerdo con ir n como la nica v a apta para solucionar el caso ambos funcionarios actuaron con un nico y delictivo prop sito lograr la impunidad definitiva de los acusados iran es y el cese de toda actividad jurisdiccional en su contra en pos de restablecer plenas relaciones comerciales a nivel estatal y dar un paso hacia un acercamiento geopol tico con la rep blica isl mica de ir n sin soportar reproche alguno por parte de la sociedad argentina ello seg n surge de la evidencia reunida y sin descartar en modo alguno la existencia de otros motivos adicionales a los aqu expuestos pero que en nada modificar an o disminuir an la criminal responsabilidad de los denunciados quiz no resulte ocioso aclarar que nada hay de reprochable en la relaci n comercial o la vinculaci n geopol tica entre estados la objeci n surge al comprobarse n tidamente que dicho acercamiento implic por parte de las autoridades del gobierno argentino aqu denunciadas sacrificar una causa judicial en tr mite desconocer lo decidido por la justicia nacional y urdir un plan criminal para borrar de un plumazo las serias acusaciones que pesan sobre los pr fugos iran es pretendiendo otorgarles impunidad definitiva algo in dito y nunca visto no se trata de una afirmaci n dogm tica se aportan en esta denuncia m ltiples elementos probatorios que confirman que el anhelo por el petr leo iran fue uno de los motores de las acciones delictivas denunciadas a modo de ejemplo puede citarse una m nima parte de la prueba descripta en este escrito como cuando femando esteche en diciembre de expres refiri ndose al gobierno argentino los tipos quieren restablecer relaciones entre los dos estados o cuando luis d el a en mayo de agreg ah habl con julio en referencia al ministro julio de vido ac hay urgencia energ tica ellos est n dispuestos a mandar a la gente de ypf a hacer negocios all en alusi n a ir n est muy interesado en cambiar lo de aquellos por granos y carne o por ltimo cuando el agente iran en buenos aires jorge yussuf khalil confirm el tema que necesita argentina es petr leo hay un verdadero inter s para empezar y entablar las relaciones comerciales de gobierno a gobierno con funcionarios del gobierno de ac una delegaci n de all viajar a o a caracas o al golfo o a beirut mejor para empezar las relaciones directas de funcionarios a funcionarios por si ello no bastara y aqu lo relevante otras pruebas vienen a confirmar que el comienzo del intercambio comercial argentino iran estaba supeditado a la ratificaci n de ir n del memorando de entendimiento es decir al avance del plan de impunidad viene al caso destacar lo dicho por jorge khalil uno de los part cipes de dicho plan ac hay luz verde para hacer las operaciones el tema es que quieren que se apure el memor ndum y se habl con de vido argentina tiene una gran necesidad de petr leo e ir n tiene una gran necesidad de granos por otro lado de vido entiende que para dar un paso en esto o sea oficial de estado a estado tiene que haber firma del memor ndum y para sorpresa e indignaci n de muchos quedar evidenciado por la prueba reunida que en estas negociaciones particip nada menos que uno de los pr fugos iran es mohsen rabbani quien recib a peri dicos reportes telef nicos de los avances que ocurr an en el seno de nuestro gobierno para citar otro ejemplo de los tantos que constan en esta presentaci n se transcribe uno de los informes telef nicos recibidos por rabbani hoy terminamos una reuni n con el ministro de planificaci n de vido en donde l est dispuesto a mandar a las m ximas autoridades de ypf para arreglar con la rep blica isl mica y la transacci n puede ser a trav s de granos y a trav s de otras cosas a lo que rabbani contest m ndeme para que eval e y luego de evaluarlo respondi aqu hay algunos sectores del gobierno que me dijeron que est n listos para vender petr leo a la argentina y tambi n comprar armas es decir mientras la justicia nacional acusaba y acusa fundadamente a ciertos funcionarios iran es de haber decidido planificado y ejecutado el atentado terrorista contra la sede de la amia y mientras p blicamente la sra presidente y el sr canciller aseguraban que sus acciones estaban exclusivamente motivadas en la b squeda de justicia para la causa amia y que el memorando de entendimiento era nica soluci n viable para el caso uno de esos imputados mohsen rabbani secreta y clandestinamente negociaba con nuestras autoridades a trav s de intermediarios y canales ocultos un intercambio de petr leo por granos la venta de armamento y lo que es m s grave a n su impunidad acaso resulte una obviedad pero no puede dejar de se alarse que las circunstancias denunciadas revisten una gravedad institucional extrema e inusitada tanto por la jerarqu a funcional de varios de los involucrados en la maniobra criminal como por la calificaci n legal del delito que se encubre esto es el delito anterior objeto del encubrimiento que es ni m s ni menos que el atentado terrorista a la sede de la amia judicialmente declarado crimen de lesa humanidad y calificado de genocidio por el juez de la causa dr rodolfo canicoba corral ahora bien para contextualizar debidamente los hechos delictivos que se denuncian resulta til recordar que la justicia argentina determin que las m ximas autoridades iran es de fueron quienes tomaron la decisi n de atentar contra la amia diagramaron la implementaci n de ese ataque y encomendaron su ejecuci n a la organizaci n terrorista libanesa hezbollah a consecuencia de ello se solicit la captura nacional e internacional del ex presidente de la rep blica isl mica de ir n ali akbar hashemi bahramaie rafsanjani del ex ministro de relaciones exteriores ali akbar velayati del ex ministro de inteligencia ali fallahijan del ex jefe de la guardia revolucionaria mohsen rezai del ex jefe de la fuerza al quds y ex ministro de defensa ahmad vahidi del ex agregado cultural de la embajada iran en argentina mohsen rabbani del ex tercer secretario de la embajada de ir n en argentina ahmad reza asghari y del ex embajador de la rep blica de ir n en nuestro pa s hadi soleimpanpour desde el a o sobre cinco de tales imputados fallahijan rezai vahidi rabbani y asghari pesan notificaciones rojas es decir la m xima prioridad de b squeda que registra interpol con apoyatura en tales imputaciones la rep blica argentina ha venido reclamando por a os a la rep blica isl mica de ir n hasta el momento infructuosamente la detenci n con fines de extradici n de los acusados iran es en efecto durante su presidencia n stor kirchner no solo llev el caso a la asamblea general de la organizaci n de naciones unidas sino que rechaz rotundamente todos los ofrecimientos de teher n siempre destinados a acordar una salida pol ticamente negociada a esta cuesti n netamente judicial da cuenta esta presentaci n de voluminosa prueba documental y de varios testimonios coincidentes del ex jefe de gabinete alberto fern ndez de los ex cancilleres rafael bielsa y jorge taiana y del ex vice canciller roberto garc a morit n que describen los pactos propuestos por ir n y su rechazo de plano por parte del ex presidente argentino esa consistencia que durante a os tuvo la postura oficial argentina en torno al caso amia sufri un cambio radical a partir de la decisi n de la actual presidente de avanzar en un plan encubridor que permita a los imputados iran es eludir y sustraerse definitivamente al accionar de la justicia a efectos de facilitar entre otros fines un intercambio comercial a nivel estatal con la rep blica isl mica de ir n dando cuenta de ello el ex canciller bielsa resalt el cambio de posici n del gobierno de la dra fern ndez cuando sostuvo ule dice a los familiares que los que comercian son las empresas y no el estado me parece un argumento pelotudo me fastidia mucho porque era un tema sagrado para n stor cuando era canciller hablar de venderle o comprarle a ir n era casus belli as las cosas por mucho tiempo la relaci n bilateral estuvo signada por la indiferencia iran a los reclamos argentinos y como contrapartida por la s lida resoluci n de nuestro pa s de no avanzar en ning n frente vincular sin antes obtener cooperaci n por parte de teher n es decir la entrega de los acusados para su juzgamiento por la justicia nacional se comprobar que en este contexto hist rico y con el cuadro de situaci n descripto entre octubre de y enero de el gobierno argentino presidido por cristina fern ndez experiment un giro de grados en relaci n a su consideraci n del caso amia efectivamente aquel enero de h ctor timerman viaj a la ciudad siria de alepo y secretamente se reuni con su par iran ali akbar salehi a quien le hizo saber que las autoridades pol ticas argentinas estaban dispuestas a renunciar a la investigaci n del caso amia y a cualquier reclamo de cooperaci n y justicia con tal de provocar un acercamiento de orden geopol tico y restablecer plenas relaciones comerciales entre ambos estados quedar demostrado tambi n que el canciller salehi tom nota de tal ofrecimiento y se lo comunic al entonces presidente ahmadinejad argentina ya no est m s interesada en resolver aquellos dos atentados en cambio prefiere mejorar sus relaciones comerciales con ir n es la primera vez que un estado agredido implora a un estado agresor que firme un acuerdo por el cual les otorgar impunidad a los agresores de este modo comenz un per odo de negociaci n secreto entre los gobiernos de argentina e ir n que se extendi hasta septiembre de y durante el cual ambas partes realizaron gestos que a la luz de la prueba recolectada posteriormente y analizados en forma conjunta claramente han sido indicativos del acuerdo que en esa poca se estaba incubando siempre a modo de ejemplo dado el car cter introductorio de estos p rrafos puede citarse que el gobierno argentino en julio de calific de muy positiva una misiva de la canciller a persa por la cual se ofrec a colaborar con la investigaci n curiosamente en una nueva hip tesis distinta a la esgrimida por la justicia avanzadas dichas negociaciones secretas donde se gest el encubrimiento y el plan de impunidad de los iran es en el mes de septiembre de cristina fern ndez de kirchner oficializ las reuniones siendo que p blicamente ante la asamblea general de naciones unidas adujo que la rep blica isl mica de ir n hab a expresado su voluntad de negociar por el caso amia se entienden ahora los motivos por los cuales la sra presidente en aquella oportunidad y por primera vez no invit a las instituciones comunitarias jud as a formar parte de su comitiva a la apertura del debate general de la citada asamblea internacional el anuncio que har a hab a sido acordado con anterioridad y con una finalidad distinta a la que se invoc quedar aqu probado que tal manifestaci n de la sra presidente fue solo una puesta en escena la primera de muchas que ocurrir an durante el camino que recorri el plan de impunidad ideado y orquestado por los funcionarios argentinos aqu denunciados con este gesto se busc ocultar que el acercamiento hab a sido promovido por argentina y no por ir n como se dijo y se quiso hacer creer que las negociaciones se iniciar an entonces cuando ya llevaban al menos un a o y medio as se acreditar que mientras transcurr an las negociaciones diplom ticas p blicas el plan de impunidad avanzaba solapadamente a trav s de canales paralelos de comunicaci n y negociaci n con ir n gest ndose en aquel momento un aspecto fundamental del plan criminal la desviaci n de la investigaci n hacia una nueva y falsa hip tesis que incrimine a terceros inocentes pero fundamentalmente desincrimine a los iran es tareas de las participaron activamente jorge khalil fernando esteche h ctor yrimia y el sujeto conocido como alian el resultado visible de las negociaciones tanto secretas como p blicas fue el memorando de entendimiento firmado el de enero de en etiop a la versi n oficial argentina indic que se trataba de un instrumento jur dico que permitir a avanzar con las indagatorias de los pr fugos la realidad fue que solo se trat de uno de los medios elegidos por las partes para viabilizar el plan criminal que negociaron durante dos a os pues su letra resultaba y resulta funcional a esta maniobra espuria que quede bien claro el acuerdo entre representantes iran es y las autoridades argentinas excede con creces la mera letra del memorando el plan criminal consisti en la eliminaci n de las imputaciones que la justicia argentina esgrimi contra funcionarios iran es y el mejor modo que se hall para despejar tales acusaciones brindar impunidad y presentar el tema de la manera m s prolija posible a los ojos de la ciudadan a enga ada fue la suscripci n del mencionado acuerdo bilateral ello fue as porque su letra prev mecanismos para lograr la baja de las notificaciones rojas de interpol porque su aplicaci n contiene tantas etapas sucesivas sin plazo alguno que permite prolongar indefinidamente su vigencia en el tiempo sin lograr avances reales porque las conclusiones de la comisi n de la verdad ya estaban arregladas de antemano y su actuaci n permite la introducci n de la nueva hip tesis falsa armada con pruebas inventadas en efecto como se ver en la pr ctica las nicas trabas a la impunidad de hecho de la que gozan los acusados iran es han sido las notificaciones rojas de interpol que tienen la capacidad de dificultar su movilidad trasnacional por ello las partes acordaron hacerlas cesar de all que el punto del memorando tenga su raz n de ser tr tase del nico punto que deb a tener aplicaci n inmediata del nico que tiene car cter operativo sin necesidad de que el acuerdo haya sido ratificado redactado en esos t rminos carece de toda explicaci n l gica se advierte entonces que la baja de las notificaciones rojas fue el primer y trascendental paso acordado secretamente entre salehi y timerman hacia la desvinculaci n definitiva de los imputados n tese que al mes de haberse firmado el memorando de entendimiento el agente de inteligencia de presidencia de la naci n alian le comunic al operador iran khalil tengo un chisme me dijeron ah en la casa en referencia a la secretar a de inteligencia interpol va a levantar el pedido de capturas de los amigos en alusi n a los pr fugos iran es lo va a levantar ahora en forma sorpresiva e inesperada para los encubridores interpol advirti que se lo quiso involucrar donde nada ten a que hacer e intercedi a tiempo para evitar la baja de las prioridades de b squeda se ver c mo esa intervenci n se erigi en un obst culo inesperado para los autores del encubrimiento timerman no pudo cumplir lo que hab a prometido en sus negociaciones secretas con ir n circunstancia que motiv la queja de los iran es rep rese adem s que desde que interpol comunic que las notificaciones rojas contra los acusados por el caso amia seguir an vigentes la rep blica isl mica de ir n retir el acuerdo de su agenda parlamentaria y hasta el momento en que se formula esta presentaci n no ha comunicado oficialmente su aprobaci n interna el motivo de semejante vuelta atr s surge n tido de las pruebas que se presentar n el agente persa khalil al d a siguiente de regresar de ir n comunic a las autoridades argentinas la raz n de la tardanza ante el reclamo local por la demora de teher n en la aprobaci n interna de memorando de entendimiento de vido tiene que saber que timerman no cumpli con algunas cosas esto es as de claro no cumpli con algunas cosas y en otra oportunidad expres meparece que el ruso este de mierda en alusi n a h ctor timerman se mand alguna estaba firmado algo donde estaba el tema de las cautelares en referencia a las notificaciones rojas m s all de los ejemplos relatados lo que se pretende dejar aqu en blanco sobre negro son dos conclusiones reveladoras que se desprenden de estos dichos como de otras probanzas que tambi n se analizar n la primera radica en la certidumbre sobre la existencia de una promesa por parte del canciller timerman para dar de baja las notificaciones rojas timerman no cumpli no porque no haya querido sino porque interpol se lo impidi incluso podr apreciarse en esta denuncia que el canciller volvi a la carga en los meses de septiembre y noviembre de con claras intenciones de convencer a ronald noble para que ceda y autorice el cese de las notificaciones rojas bajo el argumento que el acuerdo entre las partes sigui avanzando pero por fortuna tampoco entonces pudo lograr su cometido la segunda conclusi n que se desprende de aquella conversaci n transmite la certeza de que adem s del memorando de entendimiento firmado han existido entre las partes otros acuerdos secretos corrobora tal afirmaci n entre otras evidencias el testimonio del propio salehi quien reconoci sin ambages interpol debe eliminar las acusaciones contra las autoridades iran es el contenido del acuerdo entre ir n y argentina en relaci n con la cuesti n amia ser hecho p blico en el momento adecuado y la cuesti n de los imputados iran es est incluida y nosotros la estamos siguiendo habiendo sido realizada esta declaraci n en el mes de marzo de resulta evidente que salehi no se estaba refiriendo al memorando de entendimiento sino a otro convenio que a esa fecha a n no se hab a dado a conocer y en este marco deben entenderse tambi n las manifestaciones de jorge yussuf khalil cuando comentando noticias period sticas que difund an que el ex ministro de defensa iran ahmad vahidi nunca ser a interrogado pese a estar incluido en el memorando asegur que el rumor era cierto que ese tema en particular estaba conversado antes estaba dentro del marco y que el acuerdo era m s profundo todav a es decir quedar probado que el ministro de relaciones exteriores y culto de la naci n h ctor timerman no solo firm un memorando de entendimiento abiertamente inconstitucional que adem s garantiza la impunidad de los acusados iran es sino que tambi n cerr acuerdos secretos mucho m s beneficiosos para los pr fugos de all que se compruebe que no se trat como se present p blicamente de dos partes que negociaron un acuerdo bilateral sino que fueron dos socios que confeccionaron un sofisticado plan criminal de impunidad para desligar definitivamente a los pr fugos de la causa amia de toda relaci n con el atentado y cerrar toda investigaci n respecto de ellos de hecho luego de suscribirse el acuerdo el agente argentino alian le confes a su par de ir n tranquilo ya ganamos es decir ganamos una partida yo te dije vos no me ten as fe dejando en evidencia que ambas partes han tenido el mismo objetivo criminal ahora bien surge de la evidencia detallada en la denuncia que la oportuna intervenci n de interpol manteniendo vigentes las notificaciones rojas no frustr ni imposibilit a futuro el encubrimiento orquestado los autores hab an tenido la precauci n de idear mecanismos alternativos para conseguir sus fines contenidos en la letra del memorando de entendimiento se advertir sobre los numeros simos mecanismos previstos en el intrincado acuerdo bilateral naturalmente ello no ha sido fruto de la incompetencia de los redactores sino todo lo contrario de su sagacidad para dotar al memorando de un enmara ado proceso de aplicaci n que exige para que un imputado iran se siente a escuchar los cargos de la justicia argentina la verificaci n de una largu sima serie de procedimientos alguno de ellos de imposible cumplimiento atento a la incompatibilidad con sus respectivas legislaciones que ambos pa ses ratifiquen internamente los t rminos del acuerdo que se remitan mutuamente las notas reversales notificando dicha ratificaci n que cada uno de los signatarios proceda a la elecci n de personas de reconocida trayectoria jur dica y probidad personal para que integren la comisi n de la verdad que los elegidos acepten la designaci n que entre ambas partes y de com n acuerdo seleccionen un quinto miembro de la comisi n que los miembros de la comisi n redacten las reglas del procedimiento al que se sujetar n que se pida informaci n de la causa que se env e la informaci n requerida y se la traduzca que cada uno de los miembros de la comisi n analice las pruebas remitidas que se re nan para emitir recomendaciones que se notifiquen dichas recomendaciones a los signatarios que se establezca una fecha para cumplir con audiencias que se cite a los imputados que stos efectivamente comparezcan a un interrogatorio que no re ne como se ver las condiciones m nimas para ser considerado una declaraci n indagatoria v lida para el derecho argentino ninguno de estos pasos tiene plazo determinado para ser cumplido tan es as que ha pasado m s de un a o y medio desde la firma del memorando y todav a no se concluy siquiera el primer escal n ir n a n no ha comunicado la ratificaci n del acuerdo puede verse con claridad que los t rminos de este pacto reflejo de una actividad criminal subyacente est n redactados de modo tal que muy sencillamente se puede demorar en forma indefinda su cumplimiento otra llave que conduce a la impunidad definitiva es la efectiva actuaci n de la comisi n de la verdad cuya finalidad consiste en llegado el momento recibir y valorar nuevas pruebas y presentar una nueva hip tesis sin iran es como acusados legitimando el redireccionamiento de la pesquisa la comisi n evaluar una nueva verdad falsa una verdad armada artificialmente por los inescrupulosos art fices de este siniestro plan nuevamente prueba directa sostiene lo afirmado el agente iran jorge khalil el mismo d a de la firma del memorando expres alguien

i cease for the time being to see gilberte a general outline of the sorrow caused by a parting and of the irregular process of oblivion my mother when it was a question of our having m de norpois to dinner for the first time having expressed her regret that professor cottard was away from home and that she herself had quite ceased to see anything of swann since either of these might have helped to entertain the old ambassador my father replied that so eminent a guest so distinguished a man of science as cottard could never be out of place at a dinner table but that swann with his ostentation his habit of crying aloud from the housetops the name of everyone that he knew however slightly was an impossible vulgarian whom the marquis de norpois would be sure to dismiss as to use his own epithet a pestilent fellow now this attitude on my father s part may be felt to require a few words of explanation inasmuch as some of us no doubt remember a cottard of distinct mediocrity and a swann by whom modesty and discretion in all his social relations were carried to the utmost refinement of delicacy but in his case what had happened was that to the original young swann and also to the swann of the jockey club our old friend had added a fresh personality which was not to be his last that of odette s husband adapting to the humble ambitions of that lady the instinct the desire the industry which he had always had he had laboriously constructed for himself a long way beneath the old a new position more appropriate to the companion who was to share it with him in this he shewed himself another man since while he continued to go by himself to the houses of his own friends on whom he did not care to inflict odette unless they had expressly asked that she should be introduced to them it was a new life that he had begun to lead in common with his wife among a new set of people it was quite intelligible that in order to estimate the importance of these new friends and thereby the pleasure the self esteem that were to be derived from entertaining them he should have made use as a standard of comparison not of the brilliant society in which he himself had moved before his marriage but of the earlier environment of odette and yet even when one knew that it was with unfashionable officials and their faded wives the wallflowers of ministerial ball rooms that he was now anxious to associate it was still astonishing to hear him who in the old days and even still would so gracefully refrain from mentioning an invitation to twickenham or to marlborough house proclaim with quite unnecessary emphasis that the wife of some assistant under secretary for something had returned mme swann s call it will perhaps be objected here that what this really implied was that the simplicity of the fashionable swann had been nothing more than a supreme refinement of vanity and that like certain other israelites my parents old friend had contrived to illustrate in turn all the stages through which his race had passed from the crudest and coarsest form of snobbishness up to the highest pitch of good manners but the chief reason and one which is applicable to humanity as a whole was that our virtues themselves are not free and floating qualities over which we retain a permanent control and power of disposal they come to be so closely linked in our minds with the actions in conjunction with which we make it our duty to practise them that if we are suddenly called upon to perform some action of a different order it takes us by surprise and without our supposing for a moment that it might involve the bringing of those very same virtues into play swann in his intense consciousness of his new social surroundings and in the pride with which he referred to them was like those great artists modest or generous by nature who if at the end of their career they take to cooking or to gardening display a childlike gratification at the compliments that are paid to their dishes or their borders and will not listen to any of the criticism which they heard unmoved when it was applied to their real achievements or who after giving away a canvas cannot conceal their annoyance if they lose a couple of francs at dominoes as for professor cottard we shall meet him again and can study him at our leisure much later in the course of our story with the mistress mme verdurin in her country house la raspeli re for the present the following observations must suffice first of all in the case of swann the alteration might indeed be surprising since it had been accomplished and yet was not suspected by me when i used to see gilberte s father in the champs elys es where moreover as he never spoke to me he could not very well have made any display of his political relations it is true that if he had done so i might not at once have discerned his vanity for the idea that one has long held of a person is apt to stop one s eyes and ears my mother for three whole years had no more noticed the salve with which one of her nieces used to paint her lips than if it had been wholly and invisibly dissolved in some clear liquid until one day a streak too much or possibly something else brought about the phenomenon known as super saturation all the paint that had hitherto passed unperceived was now crystallised and my mother in the face of this sudden riot of colour declared in the best combray manner that it was a perfect scandal and almost severed relations with her niece with cottard on the contrary the epoch in which we have seen him assisting at the first introduction of swann to the verdurins was now buried in the past whereas honours offices and titles come with the passage of years moreover a man may be illiterate and make stupid puns and yet have a special gift which no amount of general culture can replace such as the gift of a great strategist or physician and so it was not merely as an obscure practitioner who had attained in course of time to european celebrity that the rest of his profession regarded cottard the most intelligent of the younger doctors used to assert for a year or two that is to say for fashions being themselves begotten of the desire for change are quick to change also that if they themselves ever fell ill cottard was the only one of the leading men to whom they would entrust their lives no doubt they preferred socially to meet certain others who were better read more artistic with whom they could discuss nietzsche and wagner when there was a musical party at mme cottard s on the evenings when she entertained in the hope that it might one day make him dean of the faculty the colleagues and pupils of her husband he instead of listening preferred to play cards in another room yet everybody praised the quickness the penetration the unerring confidence with which at a glance he could diagnose disease thirdly in considering the general impression which professor cottard must have made on a man like my father we must bear in mind that the character which a man exhibits in the latter half of his life is not always even if it is often his original character developed or withered attenuated or enlarged it is sometimes the exact opposite like a garment that has been turned except from the verdurins who were infatuated with him cottard s hesitating manner his excessive timidity and affability had in his young days called down upon him endless taunts and sneers what charitable friend counselled that glacial air the importance of his professional standing made it all the more easy to adopt wherever he went save at the verdurins where he instinctively became himself again he would assume a repellent coldness remain silent as long as possible be peremptory when he was obliged to speak and not forget to say the most cutting things he had every opportunity of rehearsing this new attitude before his patients who seeing him for the first time were not in a position to make comparisons and would have been greatly surprised to learn that he was not at all a rude man by nature complete impassivity was what he strove to attain and even while visiting his hospital wards when he allowed himself to utter one of those puns which left everyone from the house physician to the junior student helpless with laughter he would always make it without moving a muscle of his face while even that was no longer recognisable now that he had shaved off his beard and moustache but who the reader has been asking was the marquis de norpois well he had been minister plenipotentiary before the war and was actually an ambassador on the sixteenth of may in spite of which and to the general astonishment he had since been several times chosen to represent france on extraordinary missions even as controller of the public debt in egypt where thanks to his great capability as a financier he had rendered important services by radical cabinets under which a reactionary of the middle classes would have declined to serve and in whose eyes m de norpois in view of his past his connexions and his opinions ought presumably to have been suspect but these advanced ministers seemed to consider that in making such an appointment they were shewing how broad their own minds were when the supreme interests of france were at stake were raising themselves above the general run of politicians were meriting from the journal des d bats itself the title of statesmen and were reaping direct advantage from the weight that attaches to an aristocratic name and the dramatic interest always aroused by an unexpected appointment and they knew also that they could reap these advantages by making an appeal to m de norpois without having to fear any want of political loyalty on his part a fault against which his noble birth not only need not put them on their guard but offered a positive guarantee and in this calculation the government of the republic were not mistaken in the first place because an aristocrat of a certain type brought up from his cradle to regard his name as an integral part of himself of which no accident can deprive him an asset of whose value his peers or persons of even higher rank can form a fairly exact estimate knows that he can dispense with the efforts since they can in no way enhance his position in which without any appreciable result so many public men of the middle class spend themselves to profess only the right opinions to frequent only the sound people anxious on the other hand to increase his own importance in the eyes of the princely or ducal families which take immediate precedence of his own he knows that he can do so by giving his name that complement which hitherto it has lacked which will give it priority over other names heraldically its equals such as political power a literary or an artistic reputation or a large fortune and so what he saves by avoiding the society of the ineffective country squires after whom all the professional families run helter skelter but of his intimacy with whom were he to profess it a prince would think nothing he will lavish on the politicians who free masons or worse though they be can advance him in diplomacy or back him in an election and on the artists or scientists whose patronage can help him to arrive in those departments in which they excel on everyone in fact who is in a position to confer a fresh distinction or to bring off a rich marriage but in the character of m de norpois there was this predominant feature that in the course of a long career of diplomacy he had become imbued with that negative methodical conservative spirit called governmental which is common to all governments and under every government particularly inspires its foreign office he had imbibed during that career an aversion a dread a contempt for the methods of procedure more or less revolutionary and in any event quite incorrect which are those of an opposition save in the case of a few illiterates high or low it makes no matter by whom no difference in quality is perceptible what attracts men one to another is not a common point of view but a consanguinity of spirit an academician of the kind of legouv and therefore an upholder of the classics would applaud maxime ducamp s or mezi re s eulogy of victor hugo with more fervour than that of boileau by claudel a common nationalism suffices to endear barr s to his electors who scarcely distinguish between him and m georges berry but does not endear him to those of his brother academicians who with a similar outlook on politics but a different type of mind will prefer to him even such open adversaries as m ribot and m deschanel with whom in turn the most loyal monarchists feel themselves more closely allied than with maurras or l on daudet although these also are living in the hope of a glorious restoration miserly in the use of words not only from a professional scruple of prudence and reserve but because words themselves have more value present more subtleties of definition to men whose efforts protracted over a decade to bring two countries to an understanding are condensed translated in a speech or in a protocol into a single adjective colourless in all appearance but to them pregnant with a world of meaning m de norpois was considered very stiff at the commission where he sat next to my father whom everyone else congratulated on the astonishing way in which the old ambassador unbent to him my father was himself more astonished than anyone for not being as a rule very affable his company was little sought outside his own intimate circle a limitation which he used modestly and frankly to avow he realised that these overtures were an outcome in the diplomat of that point of view which everyone adopts for himself in making his choice of friends from which all a man s intellectual qualities his refinement his affection are a far less potent recommendation of him when at the same time he bores or irritates one than are the mere straightforwardness and good humour of another man whom most people would regard as frivolous or even fatuous de norpois has asked me to dinner again it s quite extraordinary everyone on the commission is amazed as he never has any personal relations with any of us i am sure he s going to tell me something thrilling again about the seventy war my father knew that m de norpois had warned had perhaps been alone in warning the emperor of the growing strength and bellicose designs of prussia and that bismarck rated his intelligence most highly only the other day at the opera during the gala performance given for king theodosius the newspapers had all drawn attention to the long conversation which that monarch had held with m de norpois i must ask him whether the king s visit had any real significance my father went on for he was keenly interested in foreign politics i know old norpois keeps very close as a rule but when he s with me he opens out quite charmingly as for my mother perhaps the ambassador had not the type of mind towards which she felt herself most attracted i should add that his conversation furnished so exhaustive a glossary of the superannuated forms of speech peculiar to a certain profession class and period a period which for that profession and that class might be said not to have altogether passed away that i sometimes regret that i have not kept any literal record simply of the things that i have heard him say i should thus have obtained an effect of old fashioned courtesy by the same process and at as little expense as that actor at the palais royal who when asked where on earth he managed to find his astounding hats answered i do not find my hats i keep them in a word i suppose that my mother considered m de norpois a trifle out of date which was by no means a fault in her eyes so far as manners were concerned but attracted her less in the region not in this instance of ideas for those of m de norpois were extremely modern but of idiom she felt however that she was paying a delicate compliment to her husband when she spoke admiringly of the diplomat who had shewn so remarkable a predilection for him by confirming in my father s mind the good opinion that he already had of m de norpois and so inducing him to form a good opinion of himself also she knew that she was carrying out that one of her wifely duties which consisted in making life pleasant and comfortable for her husband just as when she saw to it that his dinner was perfectly cooked and served in silence and as she was incapable of deceiving my father she compelled herself to admire the old ambassador so as to be able to praise him with sincerity incidentally she could naturally and did appreciate his kindness his somewhat antiquated courtesy so ceremonious that when as he was walking along the street his tall figure rigidly erect he caught sight of my mother driving past before raising his hat to her he would fling away the cigar that he had just lighted his conversation so elaborately circumspect in which he referred as seldom as possible to himself and always considered what might interest the person to whom he was speaking his promptness in answering a letter which was so astonishing that whenever my father just after posting one himself to m de norpois saw his handwriting upon an envelope his first thought was always one of annoyance that their letters must unfortunately have crossed in the post which one was led to suppose bestowed upon him the special and luxurious privilege of extraordinary deliveries and collections at all hours of the day and night my mother marvelled at his being so punctilious although so busy so friendly although so much in demand never realising that although with such people is invariably an unrecognised because and that just as old men are always wonderful for their age and kings extraordinarily simple and country cousins astonishingly well informed it was the same system of habits that enabled m de norpois to undertake so many duties and to be so methodical in answering letters to go everywhere and to be so friendly when he came to us moreover she made the mistake which everyone makes who is unduly modest she rated everything that concerned herself below and consequently outside the range of other people s duties and engagements the letter which it seemed to her so meritorious in my father s friend to have written us promptly since in the course of the day he must have had ever so many letters to write she excepted from that great number of letters of which actually it was a unit in the same way she did not consider that dining with us was for m de norpois merely one of the innumerable activities of his social life she never guessed that the ambassador had trained himself long ago to look upon dining out as one of his diplomatic functions and to display at table an inveterate charm which it would have been too much to have expected him specially to discard when he came to dine with us the evening on which m de norpois first appeared at our table in a year when i still went to play in the champs elys es has remained fixed in my memory because the afternoon of the same day was that upon which i at last went to hear berma at a matin e in ph dre and also because in talking to m de norpois i realised suddenly and in a new and different way how completely the feelings aroused in me by all that concerned gilberte swann and her parents differed from any that the same family could inspire in anyone else it was no doubt the sight of the depression in which i was plunged by the approach of the new year holidays in which as she herself had informed me i was to see nothing of gilberte that prompted my mother one day in the hope of distracting my mind to suggest if you are still so anxious to hear berma i think that your father would allow you perhaps to go your grandmother can take you but it was because m de norpois had told him that he ought to let me hear berma that it was an experience for a young man to remember in later life that my father who had hitherto been so resolutely opposed to my going and wasting my time with the added risk of my falling ill again on what he used to shock my grandmother by calling futilities was now not far from regarding this manner of spending an afternoon as included in some vague way in the list of precious formulae for success in a brilliant career my grandmother who in renouncing on my behalf the profit which according to her i should have derived from hearing berma had made a considerable sacrifice in the interests of my health was surprised to find that this last had become of no account at a mere word from m de norpois reposing the unconquerable hopes of her rationalist spirit in the strict course of fresh air and early hours which had been prescribed for me she now deplored as something disastrous this infringement that i was to make of my rules and in a tone of despair protested how easily led you are to my father who replied angrily what so it s you that are not for letting him go now that is really too much after your telling us all day and every day that it would be so good for him m de norpois had also brought about a change in my father s plans in a matter of far greater importance to myself my father had always meant me to become a diplomat and i could not endure the thought that even if i did have to stay for some years first at the ministry i should run the risk of being sent later on as ambassador to capitals in which no gilberte dwelt i should have preferred to return to the literary career that i had planned for myself and had been abandoned years before in my wanderings along the guermantes way but my father had steadily opposed my devoting myself to literature which he regarded as vastly inferior to diplomacy refusing even to dignify it with the title of career until the day when m de norpois who had little love for the more recent generations of diplomatic agents assured him that it was quite possible by writing to attract as much attention to receive as much consideration to exercise as much influence and at the same time to preserve more independence than in the embassies well well i should never have believed it old norpois doesn t at all disapprove of your idea of taking up writing my father had reported and as he had a certain amount of influence himself he imagined that there was nothing that could not be arranged no problem for which a happy solution might not be found in the conversation of people who counted i shall bring him back to dinner one of these days from the commission you must talk to him a little and let him see what he thinks of you write something good that you can shew him he is an intimate friend of the editor of the deux mondes he will get you in there he will arrange it all the cunning old fox and upon my soul he seems to think that diplomacy nowadays my happiness in the prospect of not being separated from gilberte made me desirous but not capable of writing something good which could be shewn to m de norpois after a few laboured pages weariness made the pen drop from my fingers i cried with anger at the thought that i should never have any talent that i was not gifted that i could not even take advantage of the chance that m de norpois s coming visit was to offer me of spending the rest of my life in paris the recollection that i was to be taken to hear berma alone distracted me from my grief but just as i did not wish to see any storms except on those coasts where they raged with most violence so i should not have cared to hear the great actress except in one of those classic parts in which swann had told me that she touched the sublime for when it is in the hope of making a priceless discovery that we desire to receive certain impressions from nature or from works of art we have certain scruples about allowing our soul to gather instead of these other inferior impressions which are liable to make us form a false estimate of the value of beauty berma in andromaque in les caprices de marianne in ph dre was one of those famous spectacles which my imagination had so long desired i should enjoy the same rapture as on the day when in a gondola i glided to the foot of the titian of the frari or the carpaccios of san giorgio dei schiavoni were i ever to hear berma repeat the lines beginning you might also like on dit qu un prompt d part vous loigne de nous seigneur i was familiar with them from the simple reproduction in black and white which was given of them upon the printed page but my heart beat furiously at the thought as of the realisation of a long planned voyage that i should at length behold them bathed and brought to life in the atmosphere and sunshine of the voice of gold a carpaccio in venice berma in ph dre masterpieces of pictorial or dramatic art which the glamour the dignity attaching to them made so living to me that is to say so indivisible that if i had been taken to see carpaccios in one of the galleries of the louvre or berma in some piece of which i had never heard i should not have experienced the same delicious amazement at finding myself at length with wide open eyes before the unique and inconceivable object of so many thousand dreams then while i waited expecting to derive from berma s playing the revelation of certain aspects of nobility and tragic grief it would seem to me that whatever greatness whatever truth there might be in her playing must be enhanced if the actress imposed it upon a work of real value instead of what would after all be but embroidering a pattern of truth and beauty upon a commonplace and vulgar web finally if i went to hear berma in a new piece it would not be easy for me to judge of her art of her diction since i should not be able to differentiate between a text which was not already familiar and what she added to it by her intonations and gestures an addition which would seem to me to be embodied in the play itself whereas the old plays the classics which i knew by heart presented themselves to me as vast and empty walls reserved and made ready for my inspection on which i should be able to appreciate without restriction the devices by which berma would cover them as with frescoes with the perpetually fresh treasures of her inspiration unfortunately for some years now since she had retired from the great theatres to make the fortune of one on the boulevards where she was the star she had ceased to appear in classic parts and in vain did i scan the hoardings they never advertised any but the newest pieces written specially for her by authors in fashion at the moment when one morning as i stood searching the column of announcements to find the afternoon performances for the week of the new year holidays i saw there for the first time at the foot of the bill after some probably insignificant curtain raiser whose title was opaque to me because it had latent in it all the details of an action of which i was ignorant two acts ofph dre with mme berma and on the following afternoons le demi monde les caprices de marianne names which like that of ph dre were for me transparent filled with light only so familiar were those works to me illuminated to their very depths by the revealing smile of art they seemed to me to invest with a fresh nobility mme berma herself when i read in the newspapers after the programme of these performances that it was she who had decided to shew herself once more to the public in some of her early creations she was conscious then that certain stage parts have an interest which survives the novelty of their first production or the success of a revival she regarded them when interpreted by herself as museum pieces which it might be instructive to set before the eyes of the generation which had admired her in them long ago or of that which had never yet seen her in them in thus advertising in the middle of a column of plays intended only to while away an evening this ph dre a title no longer than any of the rest nor set in different type she added something indescribable as though a hostess introducing you before you all go in to dinner to her other guests were to mention casually amid the string of names which are the names of guests and nothing more and without any change of tone m anatole france the doctor who was attending me the same who had forbidden me to travel advised my parents not to let me go to the theatre i should only be ill again afterwards perhaps for weeks and should in the long run derive more pain than pleasure from the experience the fear of this might have availed to stop me if what i had anticipated from such a spectacle had been only a pleasure for which a subsequent pain could so compensate as to cancel it but what i demanded from this performance just as from the visit to balbec the visit to venice for which i had so intensely longed was something quite different from pleasure a series of verities pertaining to a world more real than that in which i lived which once acquired could never be taken from me again by any of the trivial incidents even though it were the cause of bodily suffering of my otiose existence at best the pleasure which i was to feel during the performance appeared to me as the perhaps inevitable form of the perception of these truths and i hoped only that the illness which had been forecast for me would not begin until the play was finished so that my pleasure should not be in any way compromised or spoiled i implored my parents who after the doctor s visit were no longer inclined to let me go to ph dre i repeated all day long to myself the speech beginning on dit qu un prompt d part vous loigne de nous seeking out every intonation that could be put into it so as to be able better to measure my surprise at the way which berma would have found of uttering the lines concealed like the holy of holies beneath the veil that screened her from my gaze behind which i invested her every moment with a fresh aspect according to which of the words of bergotte in the pamphlet that gilberte had found for me was passing through my mind plastic nobility christian austerity or jansenist pallor princess of troezen and of cleves or mycenean drama delphic symbol solar myth that divine beauty whom berma s acting was to reveal to me night and day upon an altar perpetually illumined sat enthroned hi the sanctuary of my mind my mind for which not itself but my stern my fickle parents were to decide whether or not it was to enshrine and for all time the perfections of the deity unveiled in the same spot where was now her invisible form and with my eyes fixed upon that inconceivable image i strove from morning to night to overcome the barriers which my family were putting in my way but when those had at last fallen when my mother albeit this matin e was actually to coincide with the meeting of the commission from which my father had promised to bring m de norpois home to dinner had said to me very well we don t wish you to be unhappy if you think that you will enjoy it so very much you must go that s all when this day of theatre going hitherto forbidden and unattainable depended now only upon myself then for the first time being no longer troubled by the wish that it might cease to be impossible i asked myself if it were desirable if there were not other reasons than my parents prohibition which should make me abandon my design in the first place whereas i had been detesting them for their cruelty their consent made them now so dear to me that the thought of causing them pain stabbed me also with a pain through which the purpose of life shewed itself as the pursuit not of truth but of loving kindness and life itself seemed good or evil only as my parents were happy or sad i would rather not go if it hurts you i told my mother who on the contrary strove hard to expel from my mind any lurking fear that she might regret my going since that she said would spoil the pleasure that i should otherwise derive fromph dre and it was the thought of my pleasure that had induced my father and her to reverse their earlier decision but then this sort of obligation to find a pleasure in the performance seemed to me very burdensome besides if i returned home ill should i be well again in time to be able to go to the champs elys es as soon as the holidays were over and gilberte returned against all these arguments i set so as to decide which course i should take the idea invisible there behind its veil of the perfections of berma i cast into one pan of the scales making mamma unhappy risking not being able to go

all de tus caprichosas medidas de los prejuicios que provoca el miedo hijo de tu ignorancia el sabio que est m s all de los efectos que crees buenos o malos ricos o pobres oscuridad o luz porque est en lo esencial es decir en la mism sima causa en lo invisible de donde surge todo y cuando escuches al sabio que llevas dentro sentir s a la lluvia buena y saludable al fr o estar s tan atento a la causa que todos los efectos ser n luminosos ese estado de claridad agiornar todos los rincones por eso lo compartir s todo y a todo llegar graciosamente entonces la riqueza se multiplicar a cada paso david le pidi sabidur a a dios que le dijo no pides poco porque la sabidur a incluye todo no vives entre l mites sino en el mism simo centro de lo milagroso libre del ilusorio orden de la mente lineal excitado por la imaginaci n y armonizado por la esperanza eres un esp ritu que por un rato ocupa un cuerpo un veh culo apto para este deambular por mares y monta as entre delfines y elefantes entre ciudades y desiertos que cada tanto lo cubren todo para recomenzar el cuento y en el medio del mundo del esp ritu juega la raz n que cura el c ncer que facilita las comunicaciones que estudia el terreno de marte que puso al hombre en la luna el pensamiento te lleva a nuevos lugares y te hace ver diferentes m s ricos a los viejos y esto te cambiar tanto que cambiar tu actitud frente al mundo al que alguna vez quisiste cambiar en lugar de entenderlo y cuando cambies tendr s incidencia en l cierra los ojos y ver s todo lo que ser liberado del tiempo hist rico viajar s a la velocidad de la luz y ese viaje puede mejorar la vida de muchos porque es incalculable el poder del pensamiento que es un grandioso alquimista que puede transformar cualquier circunstancia en una fiesta es decir cualquier metal en oro una vez encendida la luz interior nada puede apagarla es tan perfecta e incorruptible como el oro que simboliza el poder de la pureza de lo esencial es decir del esp ritu que es un viaje infinito y maravilloso porque estalla a cada instante vivido con profundidad la santidad es la meta prevista para todos aunque pocos se den cuenta o se animen a entrar en los caminos que llevan a ella abandonado el ego comienzan los milagros entonces sin lucha recuperar s la fuerza natural por eso podr s provocar vida a trav s del amor hasta caminar s sobre las aguas y curar s con la palabra recuerda que jes s dijo cosas mas grandes ver n cosas m s grandes har n no est s deprimido est s distra do por tu ego que distorsiona lo contrario de la inocencia que aclara el ego confunde a las cosas con su juicio cree que las cosas son lo que l piensa que son es m s el ego cree que las palabras son las cosas el ego no vive interpreta es una constante actuaci n que nunca alcanza a la realidad en tanto la inocencia trata a todos por igual por eso est mas cerca de la felicidad de la riqueza de la tranquilidad la inocencia ve todo con asombro por eso nos lleva de fiesta en fiesta la inocencia cree lo que es una bienaventuranza la inocencia es excitante porque ve todo por primera vez para ella el mundo est lleno de novedades para la inocencia todo es un espejo porque en la inocencia tomamos conciencia que somos parte de dios es decir el que se ve a si mismo en todas las cosas el inocente se divierte f cilmente porque todo le llama la atenci n una vaca pastando el tronco de un viejo rbol las mariposas negras sobre los trigales dorados el colibr detenido en el aire el panadero sacando el pan del horno la noche estrellada la lluvia del invierno los le os ardiendo en el hogar los papeles de matisse las caravanas de las hormigas y las de los beduinos el serm n del domingo a la ma ana y el f tbol del domingo a la tarde el ego le pone nombre a las cosas pero el inocente las ve el ego las juzga el inocente las vive el ego divide la inocencia armoniza diferencias el ego depende de la mente el inocente del coraz n el ego es viejo porque depende de la memoria pero el inocente est naciendo a cada instante el ego nos agota porque siempre lucha el inocente flota graciosamente porque siempre se entrega el ego se aburre porque no puede dejar de buscar el inocente va de asombro en asombro porque siempre encuentra y puede quedarse por la eternidad gozando el mismo caballo la misma flor o la misma estrella porque el inocente est tan entregado a la vida porque cambia como ella constantemente por eso lo mismo nunca es lo mismo por eso la inocencia es fresca para siempre ahora que est s solo y tranquilo olvida lo que eres porque eso es creaci n de los dem s y escucha tu coraz n que quieres ser que quieres hacer ahora porque la vida es ahora mismo olvida lo que crees que eres y comienza ahora mismo entonces convivir s con todos f cilmente es tan grato vivir sin divisiones bueno malo rico pobre negro blanco amigo enemigo compatriota extranjero es tanta la liviandad cuando no hay enemigos que podemos volar en cualquier momento porque la alegr a tiene la simpat a de la magia no perdiste la inocencia s lo la ocultas por miedo a la burla de los que solo pueden catalogar porque la perdieron d jala salir y recomenzar n los juegos de tus primeros a os pero enriquecidos por la inteligencia lib rate de los preconceptos de la memoria y mira todo como por primera vez entonces te salvar s del aburrimiento que ensombrece a los que creen saberlo todo y no confundas a la actividad con la vida ah est el sol exactamente ah para que lo veas ah est el rbol hace muchos a os para que te des cuenta que es una maravilla lib rate de la imagen que te ayudaron a forjar los dem s y volver s a la inocencia que es nuestro estado natural entonces estar s contento con las arrugas que confirma todo lo que viviste es m s s lo en la inocencia sentir s que eres parte de todo lo que te rodea es decir que solo en la inocencia puedes ver a dios no est s deprimido est s distra do de la buena informaci n inevitable para una buena vida salom n o borges en lugar del peri dico mahler o bach en lugar del televisor amistades inteligentes y positivas en lugar de perdedores por indolencia e ignorantes desdichados por su propia decisi n de este modo recibir s la mejor energ a la esencial porque el crecimiento es natural de la vida el movimiento constante es su causa y para estar listos para los cambios debemos estar libres y atentos con las herramientas preparadas para ejecutar cuando las energ as pasen por nosotros de lo contrario se esfumar n como el humo que sale de las chimeneas por eso es conveniente estar cerca de los que son buenos receptores los despiertos los curiosos como bertrand russeil shopenhauer bradbury ecco paz krishnamurti osho por hablar de los m s cercanos el secreto de einstein era seguir a las cabezas mas altas que la suya el secreto de campbell fue meterse en todos los secretos de la historia solo la inteligencia puede detectar como se entrelazan las cosas importantes de la vida solo la inteligencia puede conectarnos con el universo hasta comprender que somos partes del por lo tanto tenemos su misma energ a nada se repite por eso hay que vivir ahora y la vida entera est en cada acto como todo puede nacer de un solo tomo y la inteligencia es la que ve antes de ver la que sabe a donde va lo que se est diciendo o haciendo las grandes consecuencias de la m nima actitud y solo el que est presente puede comprenderlo todo el que bebe directamente de la fuente de lo esencial por eso sabe que todo puede suceder por eso nada lo aflige es m s al aprender de los errores los transforma en aciertos nadie tiene derecho a la ignorancia por eso lo pagar caro y lamentablemente ensombrecer el camino de todos por lo tanto la ignorancia es una manera inconsciente del mal como el ide logo que al separar puede llegar a provocar una guerra el sabio sabe que la tarea es hacerse cargo de uno mismo y armonizar diferencias porque separar adem s de empobrecer es un suicidio por esa raz n hay muertes hasta en las canchas de f tbol el sabio no separa porque todo es parte del todo solo est atento para ver las conexiones alguna vez cant que se mueve alguna estrella cuando arranco una flor el sabio est en el r o que une todo en la energ a que lo entreteje todo el sabio sabe que es un sue o mas de dios hecho realidad salvo que lo que llamamos realidad sea otra manera del sue o donde el ignorante ve dos cosas el sabio ve una y esa una es la verdad el sabio se ve en lo que ve es iluminado e ilumina es consciente que el tambi n es luz es decir el estado m s elevado del ser lo que llamamos muerte es el estado m s sutil de la luz si quieres vida vive en paz si quieres muerte vive en guerra cuida cada palabra porque estamos estructurados en palabras no hieras ni ofendas a nadie porque de uno en otro puede volver a ti transformada en una bomba san agust n aconsejaba solo pides justicia pero ser a mejor que no pidieras nada o dicho de otra manera no interrumpas con tu peque a cabeza la grandiosa tarea del se or al que san francisco pidi haz de m un instrumento de tu paz que donde haya tristeza yo lleve alegr a que donde haya oscuridad yo lleve luz que donde haya odio yo lleve amor la oraci n dilecta de mi madre dice se or te pido perd n por mis pecados ante todo por haber peregrinado tus muchos santuarios olvidando que est s presente en todas partes en segundo lugar te pido perd n por haber implorado tantas veces tu ayuda olvidando que mi bienestar te preocupa m s a ti que a m y por ltimo te pido perd n por estar aqu pidi ndote que me perdones cuando mi coraz n sabe que mis pecados me son perdonados antes que los cometa tanta es tu misericordia amado se or no t agotes compitiendo dios sabe lo que es para ti y el dato est en tu coraz n entonces haz lo que amas no hay otra manera de vivir el mismo amor que me trajo te trajo por eso es un error decir que hacemos el amor el amor nos hizo y nos modela d a a d a y esto depende de lo blando de lo abierto que estemos y por ser obra del amor el ser humano es maravilloso a l le debemos el pan el queso el vino la m sica la pintura los aviones y las computadoras entre tantas cosas y si el hombre es lo que ama somos todo lo que fue lo que nos hizo posible desde buda hasta rembrand desde mozart a picasso desde cop rnico a freud somos el viento que refresca y la lluvia que renueva somos la nieve del invierno y las flores de la primavera somos la luna el sol somos otro fruto de dios yo soy un reci n nacido pero por la experiencia que guard mi memoria ya no quiero herir a nadie porque s que la agresi n trae enfermedad es decir complica mas las cosas somos parte de la misma cosa por lo tanto si te hago mal me hago mal antes me mov a la raz n que es subjetiva ahora el amor que es la raz n del universo pero no perd el fuego es m s ahora tiene mayor calidad porque antes quemaba y ahora ilumina es decir que pas de destructor a constructor al pobre le hablo de esperanza y al rico de conversi n la esperanza salvar al pobre y la conversi n purificar al rico la esperanza del lado del pobre y la conversi n del lado del rico acercar n a nuestros hermanos y yo vine a trabajar para ese encuentro y cuando todos se junten no habr cerraduras en las puertas ni habr fronteras entonces todos compartir n todo por lo tanto reinar el buen humor clinton y castro jugar n tenis en canc n y husseim llevar sus hijos a disneyworld no est s deprimido est s distra do de la paz por eso te pregunto cuando vas a dejar de pelear para comenzar a vivir porque no se pueden hacer las dos cosas a la vez me preguntas cuando volver jes s y te digo que nunca se fue que siempre estuvo en tu coraz n solo tienes que callar a la cabeza y escucharlo nadie se hace la gran pregunta qu soy todos siguen cumpliendo un papel generalmente decidido por los dem s como el xito y el fracaso todos son lo que se ve sus cuerpos o sus logros materiales y las cosas materiales son tan importantes que los amores que comienzan en los parques terminan en los tribunales todos ejercen la mendicidad de alguna manera olvidando o no enter ndose jam s que son pr ncipes parte de un universo extraordinario al que olvidan por peque eces locales parroquiales a veces solo familiares reconozco muchas caras y conozco algunos nombres pero pocos individuos que sepan quienes son me preguntas d nde puedes encontrarme y te digo en cualquier parte porque soy parte del universo el nombre y el oficio son distracciones c rceles limitaciones un camino que nos marcan y que seguimos ciegamente tan ocupados que jam s nos detenemos a pensar quienes somos y el esp ritu que es lo que somos no acepta condiciones por eso no hay que confundir lo material con la realidad por lo tanto no hay fronteras aunque la mayor a las necesite por miedo al infinito por eso invent instituciones como el matrimonio el nacionalismo los ideales la patria estacas a las que se ata para no tener que vivir la totalidad la casa de uno es uno por eso yo estoy bien en todas partes y a mi casa entran y de mi casa salen pensamientos y sucesos constantemente y si mi casa soy yo que soy parte de todo mi casa es este mar y esa playa esos delfines y este hotel esta silla y aquel velero que deja una estela blanca sobre el turquesa que inventa la luz que tambi n es mi casa como las sombras de los laberintos que pueblan las mentes de los locos que tambi n son mi casa como la m sica de mahler la pintura de c zanne los cigarros de chez davidoff y el rock and roll no puedes mover a tu cuerpo porque est demasiado cargado de pasado olvida hasta tu nombre y comienza de nuevo en este momento e inmediatamente sentir s que vives en un mundo maravilloso cuando sientes que no eres lo que piensas puedes volar el principio y el final es decir la vida y la muerte son invenciones de la mente como sufres cuando se va tu hijo porque te acostumbraste a pensar que eras solo padre deja el pasado de lado y sentir s toda la vida solo las mol culas se disuelven la conciencia no muere con la materia la luz de la conciencia seguir iluminando los infinitos caminos de la vida no somos tan malos como creemos por eso la paz es posible y la paz es el punto m s alto que podemos alcanzar parece que dios nos ama m s que nosotros mismos porque sigue d ndonos oportunidades todos los d as francisco ten a raz n el sol y la luna son hermanos los animales y las plantas son nuestros hermanos porque todos somos criaturas del se or entonces nuestras obras son nuestras hermanas y hermanas del sol la luna los animales y las plantas y si digo nuestras obras digo la pintura la m sica la literatura los autom viles los aviones los tel fonos las computadoras no busques afuera lo que no tienes adentro no puedes pedir amor si no lo diste no puedes pedir justicia si no fuiste justo no puedes buscar paz afuera si no la tienes dentro pero no hay apuro tienes a la eternidad delante adem s el trayecto suele ser m s emocionante que la llegada si es que se puede llegar a alguna parte entonces lo sensato es recomenzar a cada instante sin impaciencia desaparecer la violencia la vida le gana a la muerte por eso nace mas gente de la que muere y nacen mas en los pa ses pobres que en los pa ses ricos ocupados en fabricar armas para matar a la mayor cantidad de gente posible tarea grosera e in til porque la vida vence a la muerte que al fin y al cabo es una manera de recrear por eso el arte que es una fiesta sigue invent ndole f bulas a la vida para llenar de esperanza a la gente y esto en un lenguaje que nos llega a todos la belleza la paz hace nacer pueblos y enriquece a todos pueblos que se comunican entre s gracias al arte que no tiene fronteras pueblos que no dejan de elevarse como manhathan pueblos que flotan graciosamente como amsterdam pueblos de rincones luminosos como par s al que cort zar pudo ver desde buenos aires y henry miller desde new york pueblos como sevilla apoyados en el canto pueblos como copenhague de plazas congeladas para que vuelvas a los hogares donde los le os ardiendo son la mejor compa a de ravel pueblos como zurich de cajas fuertes rodeadas de lagos y cisnes fue una tragedia para salvador dal la muerte del suyo en la paz todo es creaci n es un vivir en arte la paz me sonr e me envuelve con su aire fresco la paz me hace gozar como nadie al sol de todos por la paz mi canto se eleva muy alto y agiorna los rincones m s bajos la paz es el poema que mejor me modela en la paz mis hermanos trabajan la tierra y mis hermanas tienen hijos en la paz se siente c moda la libertad y es f cil la justicia la paz es una flor donde est n todas las primaveras en la paz nos miramos a los ojos y compartimos todos nuestros sue os por audaces que sean en la paz uno es uno mismo sin esfuerzos en la paz todo me da derecho a sentirme hijo de dios no seas desagradecido piensa cuantas cosas tuvieron que conectarse desde lo m s rec ndito del universo para que fueras este que eres para que pudiera ser la ciudad donde vives piensa cuantos millones de a os tuvieron que pasar para que tuvi ramos conciencia de la maravillosa inmensidad que nos rodea de la que somos parte yo soy nosotros dice marcos constante que tiene una visi n traspersonal es decir que ya est en la nueva era abre los ojos de tu coraz n y lo ver s a dios que es lo que nos habita cuando estamos conscientes entonces sentir s que el esp ritu se recre hasta llegar al hombre que llega a tener conciencia de dios el hombre en el que se repite toda la evoluci n somos el final de una cadena extraordinaria que tiene quince mil millones de a os tal vez seamos el objetivo de la creaci n entonces nuestra religi n es universal arriesga la vida es cambio permanente por eso siempre te da revancha recuerda que el que no est dispuesto a perderlo todo no est preparado para ganar nada ahora que est s solo y tranquilo ahora que est s contigo mismo nico ser del que eres responsable te dir deja que la curiosidad te lleve donde sucede la vida no seas espectador de la televisi n sino protagonista de la tierra recuerda que a los que se animaron les debemos todo p ntate un s en la frente antes de salir a la calle para que se te acerquen los que quieren vivir sin preocuparte por el tiempo porque en una eternidad se recomienza a cada instante y no pierdas energ a cuid ndote porque la vida es bello peligro si mi madre se hubiera cuidado de mi padre yo no estar a aqu si nos juntamos somos ricos tu tienes lo que yo no tengo y viceversa y que suceder a si nos juntamos todos desde el cada uno que hay en el cada cual la vida nos propone tantas cosas permanentemente que hay que hacer mas esfuerzo para seguir siendo pobre y desdichado que rico y feliz no olvides que eres un arist crata un pr ncipe porque eres hijo del rey del universo solo tienes que darte cuenta recuerda que jes s dec a que al pan lo trae la verdad y a todo lo que necesitas entonces no hay l mites t decides a donde quieres llegar y esto con la alegr a que abre todas las puertas porque para dios siempre somos ni os entonces la vida es un juego maravilloso un juego que incluye al todo y a todos est s hecho a semejanza de dios entonces puedes recrear todo cuando dices no puedo est s diciendo no quiero ya hay demasiados m rtires necesitamos h roes lev ntate y anda yo te acompa o como te acompa ar n todos los que se animar n a vivir mejor los que terminan favoreciendo a toda la humanidad que es la grandiosa empresa a la que pertenecemos todos camina tranquilo que no te confundan los noticieros el bien es mayor a que no te distraigan de tu tarea que es alcanzar la plenitud nada como vivir en uno mismo solo as puedes sentirte en casa en cualquier parte entonces nada es lejos ni ajeno si cada uno fuera cada cual la sociedad ser a una orquesta enriquecida por todos los sonidos por todas las voces una grandiosa armon a de individuos la sinfon a donde todos aportan su voz una partitura escrita para cada uno de los instrumentos es decir una partitura respetada por todos pero esa orquesta que deber amos ser est fragmentada porque todos estamos contra todos y esto nos ha agotado y desesperanzado por eso perdimos la imaginaci n que podr a darnos alguna idea de convivencia pero el miedo que es ignorancia nos separa m s y m s y este divorcio nos enferma y empobrece a todos porque la humanidad es un repertorio riqu simo tan brillante como interminable y todos tenemos que ver porque todos venimos de un primer hombre de una primera mujer entonces hay negros y chinos en m soy tan bueno como jes s y tan peligroso como hitler soy tan musulm n como ateo muero con el que muere y nazco con el que nace todos somos fecundados y auxiliados por todos pero desestimamos a todos porque nos desestimamos en lugar de enriquecernos con el otro le escapamos nos combatimos en lugar de asociarnos y matar al otro es suicida porque es una continuaci n nuestra el odio que es miedo nos ha tra do a esta desesperanza que es donde se ahoga la imaginaci n y sin imaginaci n perdemos la bendita semejanza es decir dejamos de ser creadores la tarea es armonizar esta gigantesca variedad que es la humanidad porque esto enriquecer a a todos hasta dejamos de decir cosas bellas a las mujeres porque ahora puede ser considerado acoso sexual pronto tendremos que salir a la calle con un abogado parecer a que vivir es una secuencia de pleitos la tarea es comprender que la vida son subidas y bajadas constante movimiento es decir cambios entonces tenemos que sacar de nuestro lenguaje la palabra decadencia que es una etapa m s nada es para siempre por eso debemos estar atentos listos parar el cambio preparados para toda circunstancia porque la vida es como es no como deber a ser todo nos fue dado por lo tanto nada nos pertenece solo nos queda gozar lo creado y cuidarlo para el que vendr que es una continuaci n nuestra como nosotros somos continuadores de nuestros padres de nuestros abuelos de nuestros bisabuelos y as hasta ad n el rojo ad n como le gustaba decir a borges que cometi el peor de los pecados no fue feliz por eso se sent a perseguido por la sombra de haber sido un desdichado el primer dato de sabidur a es saber quien es el que sabe el segundo estar en lo amado que nos hace m s brillantes porque estamos m s atentos por eso rendimos m s el amor nos agiorna d tal manera que enamoramos a todos est permitido que te caigas pero no que te quedes en el suelo en este momento la sociedad est detenida por una congesti n del tr nsito que ya es desmesurado porque las ciudades ya son desmesuradas o tal vez dejamos de pensar para cambiar todas las ideas y comenzar de nuevo ya no habr grandes mitos que seguir ideolog as ahora deberemos comunicarnos de hombre a hombre porque esta es la era del individuo por eso la internet entonces aumentar la calidad desaparecer lo macro para que se oree lo micro esto quiere decir que de aqu en m s no habr televisor pol tica o familia que pueda apagar ese fuego sagrado que es el alma donde vive para siempre la inteligencia alimentada por el universo desde hace tantos siglos los que preguntan avanzan los que no preguntan se quedan es decir mueren porque la vida es movimiento todo se recrea a cada instante por eso hay que estar atento por una mujer te pierdes al resto por una casa te pierdes el mundo es decir por una esquina te pierdes mares y r o es decir delfines ballenas salmones tiburones por una familia una ideolog a y una religi n te pierdes arquitectos egipt logos poetas fil sofos chamanes antrop logos profetas miles de maneras de ver al esp ritu y las estrella orqu deas de colombia bac n giacometti nietzsche el golfo de akaba alejandr a tokio la grecia de homero que tanto am lorenz darrell guanajuato donde me enamor de catherine valetzka aunque no tuve oportunidad de dec rselo chichicastenalgo donde con una danza ordenaron a mi esqueleto par s donde rilke ve a despertar a la belleza cada ma ana al lado de roddanne el trat vere romano donde fellini dibujaba sus personajes donde el mois s de michell ngelo est harto de los turistas que lo asfixian en san pietrenvincoli donde apenas cabe londres berl n bruselas praga donde los escritores rom nticos ten an una idea tan alta de la felicidad que nunca la alcanzaban por eso se sent an desdichados tristeza que los excitaba dolor que gozaban como los cantaores flamencos y los cantores de tango madrid donde lupe siempre est al borde del pensamiento pero nunca cae miami que es el puente que comunica a los latinos con los sajones el desierto de sonora donde conoc a eric fromm que dec a que suzucki era un budista zen porque lo hab a experimentado y esa autenticidad lo hacia dif cil de leer porque el zen no da respuestas racionalmente satisfactorias pero si los libros de los intelectuales occidentales que lo explican mas f cilmente aunque no lo hayan experimentado no idolatres a nada ni a nadie porque tener una idolatr a es perder la independencia y esto es conflicto enfermedad segura como f cil se pierde lo que se gan sin esfuerzo como sigue siendo pobre el que no goza lo que le sobra el gran paso es ir de la egolatr a que te compromete que te esclaviza a tantas cosas externas a la libertad interior entonces se alcanza la paz y la paz te hace vivir todo con plenitud es decir enriquece los ltimos salvadores son dudosos pero no afectan la ense anza de buda ni enferman a la biblia la ense anza de buda no est debilitada por el que no cree en la trasmigraci n ni muere la biblia porque se enfrente al saber mas realista de la historia de la tierra y de la evoluci n del hombre como es inocente pensar en una sociedad sin delincuentes pero cualquiera puede ser mejor si se lo propone no le bastan las buenas intenciones al universo que es como es no como nos gustar a que fuera la verdadera fe comienza trabajando en uno mismo para creer en uno mismo y cuando uno est bien plantado en uno mismo se anima a ver todo entonces conocemos a la realidad y de ah en mas podemos comprenderla entonces nos salvamos de las decepciones sabemos que detr s de una m scara siempre hay otra como tambi n vemos la pureza en la desnudez las libertades del jazz y los rictus de las dictaduras aceptar la realidad es salvarse de los enga os entonces la verdad nos hace vivir plenamente no te enga es entonces nadie te enga ar s firme como buda como jes s como espinoza como einstein como ford firme pero abierto al mundo atento a las propuestas de la vida predica las virtudes pero no calles las verdades nunca te arrepentir s de haberte animado y nunca te perdonar s no haberlo hecho adem s no tienes nada que perder porque ni una sola de tus orejas es obra tuya y no te preocupes por el futuro porque al final de tu vida no te espera la cima de la monta a sino la paz del valle a nadie tienes que rendir cuenta si no haces mal a nadie como nadie tiene que explicar nada por eso no debes agotarte en las vanas tareas de querer convencer y gustar lo importante es que est s convenci,"['primero', 'malo', 'buda', 'natural', 'haya', 'mo', 'ego', 'ide',
