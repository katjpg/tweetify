then your jig is up craven it s game on you ve been fucked from the start with your carnal gore must ve picked it up from making all that hardcore porn but now your awful bores collect rotten scores only good for watchers when they wanna munch on corn but it s no wonder freddy came from your mind to escape from the kinds of depraved shit inside both our films serve as great inspirations alright mine for creative work yours for taking a life now the first nightmar wasn t bad i ll admit but when part two was written you bashed it and quit th n you ran for the hills tryna catch up to this but the third started and they dragged you back in their shit i m the mind behind the top earning horror franchise of all time another in the top five no legacy can top mine i stepped out the genre dropped billion dollar hits while your non horror flicks do they exist yeah you re stuck with the genre but you ve turned crap at it i ve seen scarier films from wes anderson and with all those marriages you ve had to let rot you ve gone through more rings than sidney prescott wes craven ghostface quiet on set you re starting to bore i thought that the nun was the loudest i d snore you re gunning to be number one but i wonder were reviewers booing the best you could conjure jumpscares into the deep blue you say no genre can stop you now superhero fans are taking shots at wan too your movies are becoming as soulless as annabelle this dummy would be nothing but a hack without his pal whannell signed yourself to blumhouse but now your talent is wasted shoulda kept that verse locked in ed and lorraine s basement it s true a dark movie can be the most frightening but i m talking plots not your damn low lighting your prosthetic effects are as common as your good bars go ask james charles if makeup is too hard you use cheap tricks my fear lingers for years in kids my satire of all your tropes is taken more serious like your cinematic universe the world will forget you so take a bow and kneel to the mcu with effects pushing limits of what s crafted by hand your method lacks all the charm the final product is bland just push a couple keys and the code does the work it s like you cgi d that verse james wan spent your childhood trapped by your parents baptist practices stripped you of all your freedom no amount of churches i haunt could ever match those religious demons practical effects are impressive true but they limit the vision of what artists can do but you had everyone rallying to ban your first production and you re really gonna rail on me for pushing buttons you re in my world now no way you can handle it your sequels proved your standards dropped worse than your daddy did you ll be forgotten in time this whole genre is mine and still no stopping my grind bitch i m wan of a kind you might also like wes craven well someone s pissy though i shouldn t be surprised when this guy gets inspired by the bottom of a pint had your agents on your ass your thoughts turned violent but when it came to film ideas your brain was dead silent while you and tiny tim were tiptoeing through the tulips i took my swamp thing and it actually concluded you re no king your movies use every trite cliche like you got possessed by the soul of michael bay jigsaw is steps away from the fame of freddy too bad he became an icon when you left already you d think your

sand lyricspart ii the sieve and the sand they read the long afternoon through while the cold november rain fell from the sky upon the quiet house they sat in the hall because the parlor was so empty and grey looking without its walls lit with orange and yellow confetti and sky rockets and women in gold mesh dresses and men in black velvet pulling one hundred pound rabbits from silver hats the parlor was dead and mildred kept peering in at it with a blank expression as montag paced the floor and came back and squatted down and read a page as many as ten times aloud we cannot tell the precise moment when friendship is formed as in filling a vessel drop by drop there is at last a drop which makes it run over so in a series of kindnesses there is at last one which makes the heart run over montag sat listening to the rain is that what it was in the girl next door i ve tried so hard to figure she s dead let s talk about someone alive for goodness sake montag did not look back at his wife as he went trembling along the hall to the kitchen where he stood a long time watching the rain hit the windows before he came back down the hall in the grey light waiting for the tremble to subside he opened another book that favorite subject myself he squinted at the wall the favorite subject myself i understand that one said mildred but clarisse s favorite subject wasn t herself it was everyone else and me she was the first person in a good many years i ve really liked she was the first person i can remember who looked straight at me as if i counted he lifted the two books these men have been dead a long time but i know their words point one way or another to clarisse outside the front door in the rain a faint scratching montag froze he saw mildred thrust herself back to the wall and gasp i shut it off someone the door why doesn t the door voice tell us under the door sill a slow probing sniff an exhalation of electric steam mildred laughed it s only a dog that s what you want me to shoo him away stay where you are silence the cold rain falling and the smell of blue electricity blowing under the locked door let s get back to work said montag quietly mildred kicked at a book books aren t people you read and i look around but there isn t anybody he stared at the parlor that was dead and grey as the waters of an ocean that might teem with life if they switched on the electronic sun now said mildred my family is people they tell me things i laugh they laugh and the colors yes i know and besides if captain beatty knew about those books she thought about it her face grew amazed and then horrified he might come and burn the house and the family that s awful think of our investment why should i read what for what for why said montag i saw the damnedest snake in the world the other night it was dead but it was alive it could see but it couldn t see you want to see that snake it s at emergency hospital where they filed a report on all the junk the snake got out of you would you like to go and check their file maybe you d look under guy montag or maybe under fear or war would you like to go to that house that burnt last night and rake ashes for the bones of the woman who set fire to her own house what about clarisse mcclellan where do we look for her the morgue listen the bombers crossed the sky and crossed the sky over the house gasping murmuring whistling like an immense invisible fan circling in emptiness jesus god said montag every hour so many damn things in the sky how in hell did those bombers get up there every single second of our lives why doesn t someone want to talk about it we ve started and won two atomic wars since is it because we re having so much fun at home we ve forgotten the world is it because we re so rich and the rest of the world s so poor and we just don t care if they are i ve heard rumors the world is starving but we re well fed is it true the world works hard and we play is that why we re hated so much i ve heard the rumors about hate too once in a long while over the years do you know why i don t that s sure maybe the books can get us half out of the cave they just might stop us from making the same damn insane mistakes i don t hear those idiot bastards in your parlor talking about it god millie don t you see an hour a day two hours with these books and maybe the telephone rang mildred snatched the phone ann she laughed yes the white clown s on tonight montag walked to the kitchen and threw the book down montag he said you re really stupid where do we go from here do we turn the books in forget it he opened the book to read over mildred s laughter poor millie he thought poor montag it s mud to you too but where do you get help where do you find a teacher this late hold on he shut his eyes yes of course again he found himself thinking of the green park a year ago the thought had been with him many times recently but now he remembered how it was that day in the city park when he had seen that old man in the black suit hide something quickly in his coat the old man leapt up as if to run and montag said wait i haven t done anything cried the old man trembling no one said you did they had sat in the green soft light without saying a word for a moment and then montag talked about the weather and then the old man responded with a pale voice it was a strange quiet meeting the old man admitted to being a retired english professor who had been thrown out upon the world forty years ago when the last liberal arts college shut for lack of students and patronage his name was faber and when he finally lost his fear of montag he talked in a cadenced voice looking at the sky and the trees and the green park and when an hour had passed he said something to montag and montag sensed it was a rhymeless poem then the old man grew even more courageous and said something else and that was a poem too faber held his hand over his left coat pocket and spoke these words gently and montag knew if he reached out he might pull a book of poetry from the man s coat but he did not reach out his hands stayed on his knees numbed and useless i don t talk things sir said faber i talk the meaning of things i sit here and know i m alive that was all there was to it really an hour of monologue a poem a comment and then without even acknowledging the fact that montag was a fireman faber with a certain trembling wrote his address on a slip of paper for your file he said in case you decide to be angry with me i m not angry montag said surprised mildred shrieked with laughter in the hall montag went to his bedroom closet and flipped through his file wallet to the heading future investigations faber s name was there he hadn t turned it in and he hadn t erased it he dialed the call on a secondary phone the phone on the far end of the line called faber s name a dozen times before the professor answered in a faint voice montag identified himself and was met with a lengthy silence yes mr montag professor faber i have a rather odd question to ask how many copies of the bible are left in this country i don t know what you re talking about i want to know if there are any copies left at all this is some sort of a trap i can t talk to just anyone on the phone how many copies of shakespeare and plato none you know as well as i do none faber hung up montag put down the phone none a thing he knew of course from the firehouse listings but somehow he had wanted to hear it from faber himself in the hall mildred s face was suffused with excitement well the ladies are coming over montag showed her a book this is the old and new testament and don t start that again it might be the last copy in this part of the world you ve got to hand it back tonight don t you know captain beatty knows you ve got it doesn t he i don t think he knows which book i stole but how do i choose a substitute do i turn in mr jefferson mr thoreau which is least valuable if i pick a substitute and beatty does know which book i stole he ll guess we ve an entire library here mildred s mouth twitched see what you re doing you ll ruin us who s more important me or that bible she was beginning to shriek now sitting there like a wax doll melting in its own heat he could hear beatty s voice sit down montag watch delicately like the petals of a flower light the first page light the second page each becomes a black butterfly beautiful eh light the third page from the second and so on chainsmoking chapter by chapter all the silly things the words mean all the false promises all the second hand notions and time worn philosophies there sat beatty perspiring gently the floor littered with swarms of black moths that had died in a single storm mildred stopped screaming as quickly as she started montag was not listening there s only one thing to do he said some time before tonight when i give the book to beatty i ve got to have a duplicate made you ll be here for the white clown tonight and the ladies coming over cried mildred montag stopped at the door with his back turned millie a silence what millie does the white clown love you no answer millie does he licked his lips does your family love you love you very much love you with all their heart and soul millie he felt her blinking slowly at the back of his neck why d you ask a silly question like that he felt he wanted to cry but nothing would happen to his eyes or his mouth if you see that dog outside said mildred give him a kick for me he hesitated listening at the door he opened it and stepped out the rain had stopped and the sun was setting in the clear sky the street and the lawn and the porch were empty he let his breath go in a great sigh he slammed the door he was on the subway i m numb he thought when did the numbness really begin in my face in my body the night i kicked the pill bottle in the dark like kicking a buried mine the numbness will go away he thought it ll take time but i ll do it or faber will do it for me someone somewhere will give me back the old face and the old hands the way they were even the smile he thought the old burnt in smile that s gone i m lost without it the subway fled past him cream tile jet black cream tile jet black numerals and darkness more darkness and the total adding itself once as a child he had sat upon a yellow dune by the sea in the middle of the blue and hot summer day trying to fill a sieve with sand because some cruel cousin had said fill this sieve and you ll get a dime and the faster he poured the faster it sifted through with a hot whispering his hands were tired the sand was boiling the sieve was empty seated there in the midst of july without a sound he felt the tears move down his cheeks now as the vacuum underground rushed him through the dead cellars of town jolting him he remembered the terrible logic of that sieve and he looked down and saw that he was carrying the bible open there were people in the suction train but he held the book in his hands and the silly thought came to him if you read fast and read all maybe some of the sand will stay in the sieve but he read and the words fell through and he thought in a few hours there will be beatty and here will be me handing this over so no phrase must escape me each line must be memorized i will myself to do it he clenched the book in his fists trumpets blared denham s dentrifice shut up thought montag consider the lilies of the field denham s dentifrice they toil not denham s consider the lilies of the field shut up shut up dentifrice he tore the book open and flicked the pages and felt them as if he were blind he picked at the shape of the individual letters not blinking denham s spelled d e n they toil not neither do they a fierce whisper of hot sand through empty sieve denham s does it consider the lilies the lilies the lilies denham s dental detergent shut up shut up shut up it was a plea a cry so terrible that montag found himself on his feet the shocked inhabitants of the loud car staring moving back from this man with the insane gorged face the gibbering dry mouth the flapping book in his fist the people who had been sitting a moment before tapping their feet to the rhythm of denham s dentifrice denham s dandy dental detergent denham s dentifrice dentifrice dentifrice one two one two three one two one two three the people whose mouths had been faintly twitching the words dentifrice dentifrice dentifrice the train radio vomited upon montag in retaliation a great ton load of music made of tin copper silver chromium and brass the people were pounded into submission they did not run there was no place to run the great air train fell down its shaft in the earth lilies of the field denham s lilies i said the people stared call the guard the man s off knoll view the train hissed to its stop knoll view a cry denham s a whisper montag s mouth barely moved lilies the train door whistled open montag stood the door gasped started shut only then did he leap past the other passengers screaming in his mind plunge through the slicing door only in time he ran on the white tiles up through the tunnels ignoring the escalators because he wanted to feel his feet move arms swing lungs clench unclench feel his throat go raw with air a voice drifted after him denham s denham s denham s the train hissed like a snake the train vanished in its hole who is it montag out here what do you want let me in i haven t done anything l i m alone dammit you swear it i swear the front door opened slowly faber peered out looking very old in the light and very fragile and very much afraid the old man looked as if he had not been out of the house in years he and the white plaster walls inside were much the same there was white in the flesh of his mouth and his cheeks and his hair was white and his eyes had faded with white in the vague blueness there then his eyes touched on the book under montag s arm and he did not look so old any more and not quite as fragile slowly his fear went i m sorry one has to be careful he looked at the book under montag s arm and could not stop so it s true montag stepped inside the door shut sit down faber backed up as if he feared the book might vanish if he took his eyes from it behind him the door to a bedroom stood open and in that room a litter of machinery and steel tools was strewn upon a desk top montag had only a glimpse before faber seeing montag s attention diverted turned quickly and shut the bedroom door and stood holding the knob with a trembling hand his gaze returned unsteadily to montag who was now seated with the book in his lap the book where did you i stole it faber for the first time raised his eyes and looked directly into montag s face you re brave no said montag my wife s dying a friend of mine s already dead someone who may have been a friend was burnt less than twenty four hours ago you re the only one i knew might help me to see to see faber s hands itched on his knees may i sorry montag gave him the book it s been a long time i m not a religious man but it s been a long time faber turned the pages stopping here and there to read it s as good as i remember lord how they ve changed it in our parlors these days christ is one of the family now i often wonder it god recognizes his own son the way we ve dressed him up or is it dressed him down he s a regular peppermint stick now all sugar crystal and saccharine when he isn t making veiled references to certain commercial products that every worshipper absolutely needs faber sniffed the book do you know that books smell like nutmeg or some spice from a foreign land i loved to smell them when i was a boy lord there were a lot of lovely books once before we let them go faber turned the pages mr montag you are looking at a coward i saw the way things were going a long time back i said nothing i m one of the innocents who could have spoken up and out when no one would listen to the guilty but i did not speak and thus became guilty myself and when finally they set the structure to burn the books using the firemen i grunted a few times and subsided for there were no others grunting or yelling with me by then now it s too late faber closed the bible well suppose you tell me why you came here nobody listens any more i can t talk to the walls because they re yelling at me i can t talk to my wife she listens to the walls i just want someone to hear what i have to say and maybe if i talk long enough it ll make sense and i want you to teach me to understand what i read faber examined montag s thin blue jowled face how did you get shaken up what knocked the torch out of your hands i don t know we have everything we need to be happy but we aren t happy something s missing i looked around the only thing i positively knew was gone was the books i d burned in ten or twelve years so i thought books might help you re a hopeless romantic said faber it would be funny if it were not serious it s not books you need it s some of the things that once were in books the same things could be in the parlor families today the same infinite detail and awareness could be projected through the radios and televisors but are not no no it s not books at all you re looking for take it where you can find it in old phonograph records old motion pictures and in old friends look for it in nature and look for it in yourself books were only one type of receptacle where we stored a lot of things we were afraid we might forget there is nothing magical in them at all the magic is only in what books say how they stitched the patches of the universe together into one garment for us of course you couldn t know this of course you still can t understand what i mean when i say all this you are intuitively right that s what counts three things are missing number one do you know why books such as this are so important because they have quality and what does the word quality mean to me it means texture this book has pores it has features this book can go under the microscope you d find life under the glass streaming past in infinite profusion the more pores the more truthfully recorded details of life per square inch you can get on a sheet of paper the more literary you are that s my definition anyway telling detail fresh detail the good writers touch life often the mediocre ones run a quick hand over her the bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies so now do you see why books are hated and feared they show the pores in the face of life the comfortable people want only wax moon faces poreless hairless expressionless we are living in a time when flowers are trying to live on flowers instead of growing on good rain and black loam even fireworks for all their prettiness come from the chemistry of the earth yet somehow we think we can grow feeding on flowers and fireworks without completing the cycle back to reality do you know the legend of hercules and antaeus the giant wrestler whose strength was incredible so long as he stood firmly on the earth but when he was held rootless in mid air by hercules he perished easily if there isn t something in that legend for us today in this city in our time then i am completely insane well there we have the first thing i said we needed quality texture of information and the second leisure oh but we ve plenty of off hours off hours yes but time to think if you re not driving a hundred miles an hour at a clip where you can t think of anything else but the danger then you re playing some game or sitting in some room where you can t argue with the four wall televisor why the televisor is real it is immediate it has dimension it tells you what to think and blasts it in it must be right it seems so right it rushes you on so quickly to its own conclusions your mind hasn t time to protest what nonsense only the family is people i beg your pardon my wife says books aren t real thank god for that you can shut them say hold on a moment you play god to it but who has ever torn himself from the claw that encloses you when you drop a seed in a tv parlor it grows you any shape it wishes it is an environment as real as the world it becomes and is the truth books can be beaten down with reason but with all my knowledge and skepticism i have never been able to argue with a one hundred piece symphony orchestra full color three dimensions and i being in and part of those incredible parlors as you see my parlor is nothing but four plaster walls and here he held out two small rubber plugs for my ears when i ride the subway jets denham s dentifrice they toil not neither do they spin said montag eyes shut where do we go from here would books help us only if the third necessary thing could be given us number one as i said quality of information number two leisure to digest it and number three the right to carry out actions based on what we learn from the inter action of the first two and i hardly think a very old man and a fireman turned sour could do much this late in the game i can get books you re running a risk that s the good part of dying when you ve nothing to lose you run any risk you want there you ve said an interesting thing laughed faber without having read it are things like that in books but it came off the top of my mind all the better you didn t fancy it up for me or anyone even yourself montag leaned forward this afternoon i thought that if it turned out that books were worth while we might get a press and print some extra copies we you and i oh no faber sat up but let me tell you my plan if you insist on telling me i must ask you to leave but aren t you interested not if you start talking the sort of talk that might get me burnt for my trouble the only way i could possibly listen to you would be if somehow the fireman structure itself could be burnt now if you suggest that we print extra books and arrange to have them hidden in firemen s houses all over the country so that seeds of suspicion would be sown among these arsonists bravo i d say plant the books turn in an alarm and see the firemen s houses burn is that what you mean faber raised his brows and looked at montag as if he were seeing a new man i was joking if you thought it would be a plan worth trying i d have to take your word it would help you can t guarantee things like that after all when we had all the books we needed we still insisted on finding the highest cliff to jump off but we do need a breather we do need knowledge and perhaps in a thousand years we might pick smaller cliffs to jump off the books are to remind us what asses and fools we are they re caesar s praetorian guard whispering as the parade roars down the avenue remember caesar thou art mortal most of us can t rush around talking to everyone know all the cities of the world we haven t time money or that many friends the things you re looking for montag are in the world but the only way the average chap will ever see ninety nine per cent of them is in a book don t ask for guarantees and don t look to be saved in any one thing person machine or library do your own bit of saving and if you drown at least die knowing you were headed for shore faber got up and began to pace the room well asked montag you re absolutely serious absolutely it s an insidious plan if i do say so myself faber glanced nervously at his bedroom door to see the firehouses burn across the land destroyed as hotbeds of treason the salamander devours his tail ho god i ve a list of firemen s residences everywhere with some sort of underground can t trust people that s the dirty part you and i and who else will set the fires aren t there professors like yourself former writers historians linguists dead or ancient the older the better they ll go unnoticed you know dozens admit it oh there are many actors alone who haven t acted pirandello or shaw or shakespeare for years because their plays are too aware of the world we could use their anger and we could use the honest rage of those historians who haven t written a line for forty years true we might form classes in thinking and reading yes but that would just nibble the edges the whole culture s shot through the skeleton needs melting and re shaping good god it isn t as simple as just picking up a book you laid down half a century ago remember the firemen are rarely necessary the public itself stopped reading of its own accord you firemen provide a circus now and then at which buildings are set off and crowds gather for the pretty blaze but it s a small sideshow indeed and hardly necessary to keep things in line so few want to be rebels any more and out of those few most like myself scare easily can you dance faster than the white clown shout louder than mr gimmick and the parlor families if you can you ll win your way montag in any event you re a fool people are having fun committing suicide murdering a bomber flight had been moving east all the time they talked and only now did the two men stop and listen feeling the great jet sound tremble inside themselves patience montag let the war turn off the families our civilization is flinging itself to pieces stand back from the centrifuge there has to be someone ready when it blows up what men quoting milton saying i remember sophocles reminding the survivors that man has his good side too they will only gather up their stones to hurl at each other montag go home go to bed why waste your final hours racing about your cage denying you re a squirrel then you don t care any more i care so much i m sick and you won t help me good night good night montag s hands picked up the bible he saw what his hands had done and he looked surprised would you like to own this faber said i d give my right arm montag stood there and waited for the next thing to happen his hands by themselves like two men working together began to rip the pages from the book the hands tore the flyleaf and then the first and then the second page idiot what re you doing faber sprang up as if he had been struck he fell against montag montag warded him off and let his hands continue six more pages fell to the floor he picked them up and wadded the paper under faber s gaze don t oh don t said the old man who can stop me i m a fireman i can burn you the old man stood looking at him you wouldn t i could the book don t tear it any more faber sank into a chair his face very white his mouth trembling don t make me feel any more tired what do you want i need you to teach me all right all right montag put the book down he began to unwad the crumpled paper and flatten it out as the old man watched tiredly faber shook his head as if he were waking up montag have you some money some four five hundred dollars why bring it i know a man who printed our college paper half a century ago that was the year i came to class at the start of the new semester and found only one student to sign up for drama from aeschylus to o neill you see how like a beautiful statue of ice it was melting in the sun i remember the newspapers dying like huge moths no one wanted them back no one missed them and the government seeing how advantageous it was to have people reading only about passionate lips and the fist in the stomach circled the situation with your fire eaters so montag there s this unemployed printer we might start a few books and wait on the war to break the pattern and give us the push we need a few bombs and the families in the walls of all the houses like harlequin rats will shut up in silence our stage whisper might carry they both stood looking at the book on the table i ve tried to remember said montag but hell it s gone when i turn my head god how i want something to say to the captain he s read enough so he has all the answers or seems to have his voice is like butter i m afraid he ll talk me back the way i was only a week ago pumping a kerosene hose i thought god what fun the old man nodded those who don t build must burn it s as old as history and juvenile delinquents so that s what i am there s some of it in all of us montag moved towards the front door can you help me in any way tonight with the fire captain i need an umbrella to keep off the rain i m so damned afraid i ll drown if he gets me again the old man said nothing but glanced once more nervously at his bedroom montag caught the glance well the old man took a deep breath held it and let it out he took another eyes closed his mouth tight and at last exhaled montag the old man turned at last and said come along i would actually have let you walk rightout of my house i am a cowardly old fool faber opened the bedroom door and led montag into a small chamber where stood a table upon which a number of metal tools lay among a welter of microscopic wire hairs tiny coils bobbins and crystals what s this asked montag proof of my terrible cowardice i ve lived alone so many years throwing images on walls with my imagination fiddling with electronics radio transmission has been my hobby my cowardice is of such a passion complementing the revolutionary spirit that lives in its shadow i was forced to design this he picked up a small green metal object no larger than a bullet i paid for all this how playing the stock market of course the last refuge in the world for the dangerous intellectual out of a job well i played the market and built all this and i ve waited i ve waited trembling half a lifetime for someone to speak to me i dared speak to no one that day in the park when we sat together i knew that some day you might drop by with fire or friendship it was hard to guess i ve had this little item ready for months but i almost let you go i m that afraid it looks like a seashell radio and something more it listens if you put it in your ear montag i can sit comfortably home warming my frightened bones and hear and analyze the firemen s world find its weaknesses without danger i m the queen bee safe in the hive you will be the drone the travelling ear eventually i could put out ears into all parts of the city with various men listening and evaluating if the drones die i m still safe at home tending my fright with a maximum of comfort and a minimum of chance see how safe i play it how contemptible i am montag placed the green bullet in his ear the old man inserted a similar object in his own ear and moved his lips montag the voice was in montag s head i hear you the old man laughed you re coming over fine too faber whispered but the voice in montag s head was clear go to the firehouse when it s time i ll be with you let s listen to this captain beatty together he could be one of us god knows i ll give you things to say we ll give him a good show do you hate me for this electronic cowardice of mine here i am sending you out into the night while i stay behind the lines with my damned ears listening for you to get your head chopped off we all do what we do said montag he put the bible in the old man s hands here i ll chance turning in a substitute tomorrow i ll see the unemployed printer yes that much i can do good night professor not good night i ll be with you the rest of the night a vinegar gnat tickling your ear when you need me but good night and good luck anyway the door opened and shut montag was in the dark street again looking at the world you could feel the war getting ready in the sky that night the way the clouds moved aside and came back and the way the stars looked a million of them swimming between the clouds like the enemy discs and the feeling that the sky might fall upon the city and turn it to chalk dust and the moon go up in red fire that was how the night felt montag walked from the subway with the money in his pocket he had visited the bank which was open all night and every night with robot tellers in attendance and as he walked he was listening to the seashell radio in one ear we have mobilized a million men quick victory is ours if the warcomes music flooded over the voice quickly and it was gone ten million men mobilized faber s voice whispered in his other ear but say one million it s happier faber yes i m not thinking i m just doing like i m told like always you said get the money and i got it i didn t really think of it myself when do i start working things out on my own you ve started already by saying what you just said you ll have to take me on faith i took the others on faith yes and look where we re headed you ll have to travel blind for a while here s my arm to hold on to i don t want to change sides and just be told what to do there s no reason to change if i do that you re wise already montag felt his feet moving him on the sidewalk toward his house keep talking would you like me to read i ll read so you can remember i go to bed only five hours a night nothing to do so if you like i ll read you to sleep ni,"['page', 'dog', 'trust',

homie welcome to your own lobotomy you may have sent dirtbag dan back to local comedy but ain t no one stopping me we re at world domination right the whole globe is watching me ain t that about a bitch like a rone biography i said my dude i m honestly happy for you i thought you d never be the champ son shit we six bars into this title match and it s already better than the last one i mean i m way too advanced son i can do shit that you ve never did that s why i gotta take his last breath before he get a second wind i mean i heard you was gonna get personal with me i must ve got in his head y all been begging for a king but instead you got a god in the flesh you want your style your style is as obvious as it gets you rap like how bitches baby talk to their pets like oh you gon rap like this you think you ve got it handled oh you gon talk to daniel like a cocker spaniel arf boy i catch you slipping on yo campus while you flannel boy i gotta chopper knock you our your socks and sandals bitch so don t panic your punches do no damage i ll elbow turn your nose into nothing but bone fragments body blows give him a bleeding heart like a hopeless romantic i m nomadic i leave earth with no hope of going home to my own planet you my bro adam but that don t mean i won t go at him throw blows at him bury him up to his throat and throw stones at him you get cold feet i toe tag you you know that chrome magnum but that forehead cro magnon my bullets hit you ricochet and hit gully and organik i said they keep calling you a king but i think this king needs the boot i mean honestly this whole chain needs a control alt delete and reboot this guy called me a fucking weed man but i think we can see the truth i think he s just jealous of the weeds at least weeds has some roots i mean my dude you dressed up like fucking abraham lincoln trying to gain some views and then you rapped about freeing slaves while all the black people tried to escape the room the craziest shit is out of all the angles this lame could use it s funny you dress like abe lincoln but you re the one getting the chain removed i m way too smooth you ain t never been great let s face facts adam i m already a legend today but i swear to god the only thing black in your house is electrical tape he probably calls the cops on his own shadow like stop him he s getting away you re a fucking faggot with no stripes you wanna gamble but no dice this fool adam is so white he won t even reach in his bars he s had everything handed to him his whole life i said he ll out write me and then out white me you don t want to mess with dude he s never struggled a day in his life his parents put him on a pedestal he s got a top five but no non white rappers he s got a tattoo right above his champ stamp that says alllivesmatter he loves chai tea tai chi he hates spike lee doing the right thing he loves skyping typing hiking biking third reiching evidence hiding stereotyping racial profiling pretty much any white thing homie you ain t anything like me you ain t prepped for survival cause a year from now nobody s gonna remember when you went viral you may have cheated death before with illmac but now your destination is final we can all judge this book by this cover cause the story ends with the title round rone roney bae the king formerly the prince i call him cocker spaniel cause he s always been my bitch oh so you re the super villain career ender well i dig that i heard you even ended a marriage before well that s a sick stat but my rhymes change lives too you doubt my impact have you seen big t lately he s with a six pack world domination what i gotta break him down geographically i mean taiwan fucks with me i guess i got that taipei personality i mean chicas want my calvin s off no strap to get my style across cause i rap like i got an eagle that s the size of an albatross i was whipping the drop regal that s blacker than don cheadle you re pall bearer the jaw ring gon say shells these are not beatles do you like your pops leave you horror script and the plots evil and i already killed you once my stories all got sequels i ll run up on him like the rocky steps slash him with a hockey stick i killed him once i gotta kill him again like he s a zombie flick but there s no skeletons in my closet so this ain t another body you re only as good as the dirt you have and you have nothing on me i mean i didn t cheat on my girl not a whore in my house but not because i have morals let me just dispel that lie now and not because of love let me shoot that right down i didn t cheat cause i was scared fucking caustic would find out fucking sherlock holmes he bides his time thinking he s kinda sly stealing receipts checking what i would buy like some kind of private eye but i got hip to the game quicker we re not painting the same picture kay wigger there s a difference between a dirt digger and a grave digger see you re finished well done stick a fork him the mortician the liter ford engine the unicorn i m porzi is in the form with it i m ben simmons on the floor spinning a centaur while he s formed shifting but caustic is just light and projection it s pure physics you had the same hair beard combo as every pussy at coachella so you can not be hard it s a simple little fact plus you have the same voice as the pig from toy story so it s only right i dump that nickel in his back yo i ll hit your niece with the braces get her tea bagged til her teeth snag i m her new dentist you fuck with juventus i use your team flag as a skeet rag i ll let the team shag i could get half of your family tree bag your baby mom is does speed and let s her jeans sag your baby mom looks like a drag queen i ll get your queen dragged rip his beard off do his adam s apple like a speed bag i don t care if soul s punch was softer than a fucking bean bag you got slapped and just stood there just like that shit was freeze tag i mean damn daniel i bet that pussy wet as dam daniel that pussy got man handled he hit it then kick it out he told to go pan handle watch me grand stand you punching sounds van damme you punching sounds damn daniel you don t understand i m snuffing your man s candle watch me back stab you over and over again like the needle gone on a back tattoo check check martin havlat you fold him zip him knapsack you style on him rat pack you whip my phone out fucking battle and beat him then fucking snapchat you but wait wait wait wait maybe keeping it all rappity rap is keeping it too basic so if i acted how you act well how would you take it cause if i was you i would probably name your girl and call her a hot mess if i was you i would take your statements out of context if i was you i d go low and come at your pops next if i was you i d probably blame you for cadalack ron s death i mean getting high getting high listen to me caustic listen to me caustic getting high in front of a recovery addict why would he need that i can t believe that so if i was you i would probably blame you for his relapse but i m not you i m not you i just know my friend would like to hear his name dropped and i miss him you miss him too well i ma put you in the same spot rest in peace that s one you might also like round caustic ooh he s gonna get personal with me oh gee golly wiz i can t wait why don t you go drink some fucking bleach since you think being white s that great you used to be my right hand man now you don t deserve my handshake game of thrones shit still the king slayer even though my right hand fake i said i wish a motherfucker would i be chopping em down blocks will come out i be making mr booblaka chilaka boo sounds when it comes to rapping bitch i ve been snapping longer than locker room towels i ll have you stretched on a table with the doctors around just to tell you you ass out like a hospital gown oh so i was walking around thinking like dude what would make adam just madder than hell what would take all the wind outta his sails then he said well we should mention our girls names well don t you date that bitch allison dale yeah why don t you pass the message to that slut and tell her i can excel in every way that adam has failed if you look at her pictures her eyes are sad you can tell she s so used to having two hands grabbing her tail and get her asshole impaled by more african males than a packed attica jail and that s hard you know that s a hard thing to live up to but he makes up for it with a strong back rub and a solid i love you he be kissing that bitch on the mouth like it s the love of his life but deep down he knows he just ain t fucking her right she s got the black snake moan she likes a little mud in her pipes i don t even know why she fucks this guy he s all types of bitch he s got red lips and rosy cheeks who the fuck you supposed to be tyler swift you fucking giant vagina lip i don t get what part you re not understanding i don t know any other man in the world that could ve called to have a mirror match with a tranny i mean this is the difference between us y all looking at a glimpse of a genius but with all these pussy ass feminine little physical features we all agree there s no shame if you decide to get rid of your penis well hold on i got a question how come every time somebody mentions a time rone got molested his face immediately looks like he just got a botox injection now it s my chance to get him so i better get him i mean fans love to tell you what you can and can t talk about but you know me i never listen they said it s an automatic loss if you talk about sandusky or any of his alleged victims well as far as i m concerned if you getting defensive about getting molested then you probably got fucking molested with em now i know talking about sandusky is played but y all know i got a little something to say to be honest adam i ve studied your case and i m not saying that being molested makes somebody gay but you were on the track team at any point did you consider just running away is that not something you would try i mean all those years of learning how to take a baton from behind it s like you learned nothing from the guy i mean maybe that s why your little album committed was trash you haven t dealt with all that shit from your past maybe all those sandusky dicks in your ass changed your pitch when you rap all those sexual assaults and you never did nothing back you got raped by your running coach no wonder you sound like such a bitch on your tracks see i like saying shit like that just to watch him get rattled but if you wanna see some really weird shit why don t you check out his complement battle now the second i turned it on i knew there was something fucking strange going down out here but it did answer a long time question who s dick do you gotta suck to get a title shot around here and then you think and it s just you know it s just adam and patrick they re always coming up with the wackiest antics you know running around canada acting like faggots but that s the part that makes me think somebody really raped you maybe you overplay the gay thing to cover up how uncomfortable it actually makes you so while you were out there pretending to be a couple gay dudes how about the fact that for all that gay shit you did pat never actually paid you aw this shit just got incredibly real aye he done sucked a dude s dick and didn t even keep up his end of the deal adam calling every day and pat s like don t worry adam you getting it still and then you took him out to dinner in l a and you got fucking left with the bill that s amazing my dude pat screwed you for two stacks and you didn t do shit bitch what part of philly did they do that i mean and i don t blame him look at pat he d fucking whoop his ass he wasn t trying to scuffle but he played it like it was an accident but you actually kind of got hustled i bet you was having sandusky flashbacks yelling at pat like why did i trust you it sucks adam you just can t help but get fucked by the guys you look up to i said you either real or you ain t dawg there ain t no in between we ain t cut from the same cloth i m tailor made for the game or so it would seem cause when it comes to rhyming i m on top if you know what i mean you a cup of noodle i ll peel your lid back just to blow off some steam infrared beams look like techno lasers dealership maintenance you just met your maker so now s a good time to go ahead and accept your savior before i make the devil your fucking next door neighbor i said that s a sign you re a bitch i ain t here to impress no haters i said the deuce deuce is a good buy bye i protect my paper in a fair one you won t fare well i don t respect yo gangsta plus i got a piece so long it ll catch you later bitch round rone man that fucking gangsta shit is the weirdest shit i ve heard about you i talked to the rest of the white battle rappers and to be honest the fellas are getting worried about you bro it s like you can t decide if you re jamal or geppetto an italian who acts black where you from the spaghetto talking about this fake drug dealer shit selling copping never stopping bragging bout who he sold to benny robby jenny johnny he even made a deal in a denny s lobby with hammurabi bro you know who else sold weed before fucking everybody bro my little sister sold packs of loud shit you don t hear her bragging bout it my grandma s stylist was packing ounces shit so was my dad s accountant if you do all this secret illegal shit then why would you tell us he s like gangsters move in silence and did i mention i sell drugs well i roof whatever drugs you got i m talking crack pills heroin even if it s legal drugs i m talking advil claritin i ll throw your bitch off the roof like i m dan bilzerian i ll throw your shoes on the phone line while your man s still wearing em you wife her i ll snipe her like click click boom la di da di she on the patch then i m slick rick smooth i ll send a photo of the bands then send a dick pic through that s the chicken and the beef like a mcpick but i got a top five reasons you should not rap number you are a cable guy for comcast you know what fuck the list we can stop flat reasons one through five they are all that fucking cable guys deserve a special section of hell where the devil tortures them sometime between seven and twelve fucking fairy the cable guy our second battle isn t stressing me but i feel like matthew broderick cause the cable guy is obsessed with me so this for every time you said five and showed up after six this is for every stranger s toilet that you clogged with a massive shit this is for every shitty operator y all have ever had talk to me every one of them in india who claims they re down the block from me fucking cable companies are an inherently un american symbol comcast runs a monopoly and you just play the thimble so i want remunerations for dealing with your faggot shit so after i beat you you re hooking me up with all of the sports packages you know what fuck all the sports packages i don t want sports packages let me be more accurate i want the porn packages fucking skinemax gimme that bunny ranch i fucks with that he s already asked but here s something you should know about me now if i can t have battle rap i will burn it to the ground i mean dizaster s been ducking me like i m not in that class dizaster s been ducking me like some kind of math class i heard tay roc run his mouth how is he a threat bro i would take care of roc like a chia pet bro i would take care of roc like a pg vet bro i would take care of roc like a vet pg i whip roc like nash when he s mvp i would get rid of roc like it s nbd i ll roc like the studios at nbc and y all might think i m losing focus but maybe you should know this before the battle i instagram d evidence that he doesn t write his own shit so log onto adamferrone to read every word now or just wait cause we ll get into it in that third round round caustic yo you mentioned my homie ron i swear to god i m a writer bitch i could check this dick and feel nothing i m like bonnie godiva they said caustic did you see day cane was snapping i was like yeah yes but all his good lines were about me so i guess he still needs caustic bars to get a major reaction i said oh you didn t buy nothing right cane what the fuck were you paying for when you made the transaction you know what you can just walk around with this l but i guess stranger things have happened i said my dude came it was three years i was hoping that you d change but you re still the same bum begging for bars with loose change i said you still got your mouth wrapped around another dude s name you re like a shamed olympian blaming the steroids for the poor decisions that you made i said al can fucking blow me at this point al owes me some alimony acting like i snitched on somebody no i just alerted my actual homie about some fucking stranger who didn t pay me the fucking full amount that he owes me but i m no angle though we ve all gotten a couple bars along the way you know but shit if we wanna talk about the ratio i don t need a bunch of facebook conversations posted to tell you what i gave to rone oh did you forgot when we were out there in england don t flop for the weekend you couldn t finish your rounds cause you was too busy drinking i gave you a whole round for youthoracle right in front of you without even blinking you re like hey thanks caustic i m sorry i choked but you don t write how i be normally speaking but hey it d be cool if we could keep this our little secret awww you little fucking faggot dude aye you mad at me what about a week before your battle with t and didn t have much help to give you but i did give you a little something didn t i you manatee rone never caustic never i mean imagine me bunch of people get credit for my writtens but i can tell you like this i ve taken a lot less than i ve given so whoever s feeding you your information is telling you some fucking fiction and besides erik foreman helped you write this whole fucking battle so what s the fucking difference no see if you look at his name it ll prove that he s a hypocrite in the long run cause he likes to sit around and call people frauds even though you r one i said i know who i am these battlers should have a natural fear but this is your second title match i ve had bars in title matches for the last three and half years and if you re confused you think that shit is weird and you don t think that shit is actually true then why aren t you taking a second and ask half of the fucking battlers in this room but it s rone it s rone who they ve given me he composes it like a symphony he s simply says simple things a bunch of filler schemes and similes but he hides it behind this whiny high pitched delivery so you can t tell he s the least quotable rapper in king of the dot history i mean every since you became a little mini celebrity you think you got all the answers like that guinea from jeopardy i m sick of this fucking rich dickhead kid disrespecting me the only privileged i ever had in my life was a fifth of hennessy and after i finish that i m gonna find your little sister stephanie and dig her the fuck out like a hysterectomy see him and erik foreman have been on the internet instant messaging desperately trying to discredit me to make me lose i swear to god they ll do anything but i ve got enemies got a lot of enemies but both you faggots bout to get the same vasectomy but since you re a man of education let s look at it scientifically you lost momentum while i gave it a simple transfer of energy cause if you break it down to the chemistry your volume to the masses doesn t have any density cause even in the most basic of matters you just can t trust adams cause they make up everything rone you re a liar bro you re a liar caustic i m a liar i m a liar that s your observation the best you got is a photoshop conversation suck a fucking dick that shit is fucking finished you re supposed to be a fucking champion now you out here coming with gimmicks dude that shit is fucking actually true if you were a real fucking champion you would ve showed up to the event and interacted with fans like champions do your trend ended before you started you re the ed hardy of battling dude dude i was gonna retire after i won this shit that s some shit i thought i never would say i was just gonna take the chain and left y all for dead then i thought about it is that really how this legend will end then i said fuck it i d rather stay and break pat s record instead let s go round rone so this is not a regular battle round you know a verse on his weaknesses so fuck a crowd fuck a crown these are personal grievances so let s not mince words you missed your first battle with big t cause you were hungover from some bad coke on friday you re doing great the next day you can t go once the fans had their money paid and that s why you re fucking fake cause you were in chicago at the venue but couldn t go because a tummy ache bro what the eff is that how is he your expecting champ when he might miss any heavy scratch from a bout of the menstrual cramps fuck losing any respect mine for dude didn t exist cause i did the same drugs and was fine your immune system s a bitch but the very worst thing from the scene from that night worse than mr free drugs being a fiend for that white is your slogan free drugs i was believing the hype and then i watched you pay for those shitty drugs at a fucking premium price i mean what happened to the slogan dawg i really believed that when i say grandmom s favorite grandson ask my grandmom i really mean that but yo there s something bigger about your fame that has driven me insane how you made your whole name off of ghostwriting for arcane but behind the scenes us battlers know you in a different way you are the most notorious recipient of shared bars in the game oh y all want names y all want names fresco never gave you bars fredo never gave you bars frank stacks never gave you bars d lor never gave you bars fucking reverse live never gave you bars fucking real deal never gave you bars bro fucking marvwon never gave you bars madness never gave you bars bro and that s the ones i know imagine ones i don t imagine all his secrets if that s the stuff he shows i mean the first time he called me for bars we weren t even bros then it was against fucking roosevelt and that was back in it s really just incredible what he does behind the scenes i watched five battlers give him bars for mr vers arsonal chedda cheese every battle it s obscene last year vers big t it was full four bar schemes and you still skipped the battle after i directly gave you bars so stop lying you are not genius that you claim you are battles on hours notice really aren t that exciting for him when you realize he probably has like people writing for him i mean fucking getting bars burning bridges that just shows he s a selfish guy his slogan free drugs that explains his health s decline but after all his snitching it was on himself this time cause mr free drugs has always needed someone else s lines and the way you vilified arcane when you are ten times the cheater that s like getting ethic lessons from fucking carlos mencia go and get your ghostwriters i guarantee they re not enough oh you write your own shit yeah so does melania trump i said you really can t compare duke i say shit they re scared to you dig dirt find someone that s written for me i fucking dare you bro this is for all that bad karma you built up all that cattiness displayed because all of that bad karma that comes back to you today so i hope you get stds to what you said to q shinobi based on what you said to k i hope you lose one of your closest homies for what you said to caddy i wish you dope scared veins and your mom deserves to die for what you said about arcane based on soul i hope your girl moves away far from you from jeff i hope she cheats just to make it hard from you from ex i i hope you know the guy and just to make it horrible i hope it s one of your best friends from what you said to arsonal i hope they run a train on her from what you said to cortez i hope she gets a restraining order from what you said to megadeath then i hope you get back together and the two of you have babies and i hope that fucking kid s retarded from what you said to matt daley bro you are a rat and a snake that s just how i see him this is bigger than rap beefing both coasts or regions so i m not lobbying for a win and i don t care if you believe it but any league where he s the champ isn t one i want to be

USA",spotify:track:5VKAjUbbo00rteD2SUgaYG,chapter carter reagan bush the bipartisan consensus lyricshalfway through the twentieth century the historian richard hofstadter in his book the american political tradition examined our important national leaders from jefferson and jackson to herbert hoover and the two roosevelts republicans and democrats liberals and conservatives hofstadter concluded that the range of vision embraced by the primary contestants in the major parties has always been bounded by the horizons of property and enterprise they have accepted the economic virtues of capitalist culture as necessary qualities of man that culture has been intensely nationalistic coming to the end of the century observing its last twenty five years we have seen exactly that limited vision hofstadter talked about a capitalistic encouragement of enormous fortunes alongside desperate poverty a nationalistic acceptance of war and preparations for war governmental power swung from republicans to democrats and back again but neither party showed itself capable of going beyond that vision after the disastrous war in vietnam came the scandals of watergate there was a deepening economic insecurity for much of the population along with environmental deterioration and a growing culture of violence and family disarray clearly such fundamental problems could not be solved without bold changes in the social and economic structure but no major party candidates proposed such changes the american political tradition held fast in recognition of this perhaps only vaguely conscious of this voters stayed away from the polls in large numbers or voted without enthusiasm more and more they declared if only by nonparticipation their alienation from the political system in percent of those eligible to vote voted in the presidential election by this figure had dropped to percent in a cbs news and new york times survey over half of the respondents said that public officials didn t care about people like them a typical response came from a plumber the president of the united states isn t going to solve our problems the problems are too big there was a troubling incongruity in the society electoral politics dominated the press and television screens and the doings of presidents members of congress supreme court justices and other officials were treated as if they constituted the history of the country yet there was something artificial in all this something pumped up a straining to persuade a skeptical public that this was all that they must rest their hopes for the future in washington politicians none of whom were inspiring because it seemed that behind the bombast the rhetoric the promises their major concern was their own political power the distance between politics and the people was reflected clearly in the culture in what was supposed to be the best of the media uncontrolled by corporate interest that is in public television the public was largely invisible on the leading political forum on public television the nightly macneil lehrer report the public was uninvited except as viewer of an endless parade of congressmen senators government bureaucrats experts of various kinds on commercial radio the usual narrow band of consensus excluding fundamental criticism was especially apparent in the mid s with ronald reagan as president the fairness doctrine of the federal communications commission requiring air time for dissenting views was eliminated by the s talk radio had perhaps million listeners treated to daily tirades from right wing talk show hosts with left wing guests uninvited a citizenry disillusioned with politics and with what pretended to be intelligent discussions of politics turned its attention or had its attention turned to entertainment to gossip to ten thousand schemes for self help those at its margins became violent finding scapegoats within one s group as with poor black on poor black violence or against other races immigrants demonized foreigners welfare mothers minor criminals standing in for untouchable major criminals there were other citizens those who tried to hold on to ideas and ideals still remembered from the sixties and early seventies not just by recollecting but by acting indeed all across the country there was a part of the public unmentioned in the media ignored by political leaders energetically active in thousands of local groups around the country these organized groups were campaigning for environmental protection or women s rights or decent health care including anguished concern about the horrors of aids or housing for the homeless or against military spending this activism was unlike that of the sixties when the surge of protest against race segregation and war became an overwhelming national force it struggled uphill against callous political leaders trying to reach fellow americans most of whom saw little hope in either the politics of voting or the politics of protest the presidency of jimmy carter covering the years to seemed an attempt by one part of the establishment that represented in the democratic party to recapture a disillusioned citizenry but carter despite a few gestures toward black people and the poor despite talk of human rights abroad remained within the historic political boundaries of the american system protecting corporate wealth and power maintaining a huge military machine that drained the national wealth allying the united states with right wing tyrannies abroad carter seemed to be the choice of that international group of powerful influence wielders the trilateral commission two founding members of the commission according to the far eastern economic review david rockefeller and zbigniew brzezinski thought carter was the right person for the presidential election of given that the watergate plagued republican party was a sure loser carter s job as president from the point of view of the establishment was to halt the rushing disappointment of the american people with the government with the economic system with disastrous military ventures abroad in his campaign he tried to speak to the disillusioned and angry his strongest appeal was to blacks whose rebellion in the late sixties was the most frightening challenge to authority since the labor and unemployed upsurges in the thirties his appeal was populist that is he appealed to various elements of american society who saw themselves beleaguered by the powerful and wealthy although he himself was a millionaire peanut grower he presented himself as an ordinary american farmer although he had been a supporter of the vietnam war until its end he presented himself as a sympathizer with those who had been against the war and he appealed to many of the young rebels of the sixties by his promise to cut the military budget in a much publicized speech to lawyers carter spoke out against the use of the law to protect the rich he appointed a black woman patricia harris as secretary of housing and urban development and a black civil rights veteran andrew young as ambassador to the united nations he gave the job of heading the domestic youth service corps to a young former antiwar activist sam brown his most crucial appointments however were in keeping with the trilateral commission report of harvard political scientist samuel huntington which said that whatever groups voted for a president once elected what counts then is his ability to mobilize support from the leaders of key institutions brzezinski a traditional cold war intellectual became carter s national security adviser his secretary of defense harold brown had during the vietnam war according to the pentagon papers envisaged the elimination of virtually all the constraints under which the bombing then operated his secretary of energy james schlesinger as secretary of defense under nixon was described by a member of the washington press corps as showing an almost missionary drive in seeking to reverse a downward trend in the defense budget schlesinger was also a strong proponent of nuclear energy his other cabinet appointees had strong corporate connections a financial writer wrote not long after carter s election so far mr carter s actions commentary and particularly his cabinet appointments have been highly reassuring to the business community veteran washington correspondent tom wicker wrote the available evidence is that mr carter so far is opting for wall street s confidence carter did initiate more sophisticated policies toward governments that oppressed their own people he used united nations ambassador andrew young to build up good will for the united states among the black african nations and urged that south africa liberalize its policies toward blacks a peaceful settlement in south africa was necessary for strategic reasons south africa was used for radar tracking systems also it had important u s corporate investments and was a critical source of needed raw materials diamonds especially therefore what the united states needed was a stable government in south africa the continued oppression of blacks might create civil war the same approach was used in other countries combining practical strategic needs with the advancement of civil rights but because the chief motivation was practicality not humanity there was a tendency toward token changes as in chile s release of a few political prisoners when congressman herman badillo introduced in congress a proposal that required the u s representatives to the world bank and other international financial institutions to vote against loans to countries that systematically violated essential rights by the use of torture or imprisonment without trial carter sent a personal letter to every congressman urging the defeat of this amendment it won a voice vote in the house but lost in the senate under carter the united states continued to support all over the world regimes that engaged in imprisonment of dissenters torture and mass murder in the philippines in iran in nicaragua and in indonesia where the inhabitants of east timor were being annihilated in a campaign bordering on genocide the new republic magazine presumably on the liberal side of the establishment commented approvingly on the carter policies american foreign policy in the next four years will essentially extend the philosophies developed in the nixon ford years this is not at all a negative prospect there should be continuity it is part of history carter had presented himself as a friend of the movement against the war but when nixon mined haiphong harbor and resumed bombing of north vietnam in the spring of carter urged that we give president nixon our backing and support whether or not we agree with specific decisions once elected carter declined to give aid to vietnam for reconstruction despite the fact that the land had been devastated by american bombing asked about this at a press conference carter replied that there was no special obligation on the united states to do this because the destruction was mutual considering that the united states had crossed half the globe with an enormous fleet of bombers and million soldiers and after eight years left a tiny nation with over a million dead and its land in ruins this was an astounding statement one establishment intention perhaps was that future generations see the war not as it appeared in the defense department s own pentagon papers as a ruthless attack on civilian populations for strategic military and economic interests but as an unfortunate error noam chomsky one of the leading antiwar intellectuals during the vietnam period looked in mid at how the history of the war was being presented in the major media and wrote that they were destroying the historical record and supplanting it with a more comfortable story reducing lessons of the war to the socially neutral categories of error ignorance and cost the carter administration clearly was trying to end the disillusionment of the american people after the vietnam war by following foreign policies more palatable less obviously aggressive hence the emphasis on human rights the pressure on south africa and chile to liberalize their policies but on close examination these more liberal policies were designed to leave intact the power and influence of the american military and american business in the world the renegotiation of the panama canal treaty with the tiny central american republic of panama was an example the canal saved american companies billion a year in delivery costs and the united states collected million a year in tolls out of which it paid the panama government million dollars while maintaining fourteen military bases in the area back in the united states had engineered a revolution against colombia set up the new tiny republic of panama in central america and dictated a treaty giving the united states military bases control of the panama canal and sovereignty in perpetuity the carter administration in responding to anti american protests in panama decided to renegotiate the treaty the new york times was candid about the canal we stole it and removed the incriminating evidence from our history books by the canal had lost military importance it could not accommodate large tankers or aircraft carriers that plus the anti american riots in panama led the carter administration over conservative opposition to negotiate a new treaty which called for a gradual removal of u s bases which could easily be relocated elsewhere in the area the canal s legal ownership would be turned over to panama after a period the treaty also contained vague language which could be the basis for american military intervention under certain conditions whatever carter s sophistication in foreign policy certain fundamentals operated in the late sixties and the seventies american corporations were active all over the world on a scale never seen before there were by the early seventies about three hundred u s corporations including the seven largest banks which earned percent of their net profits outside the united states they were called multinationals but actually percent of their top executives were americans as a group they now constituted the third largest economy in the world next to the united states and the soviet union the relationship of these global corporations with the poorer countries had long been an exploiting one it was clear from u s department of commerce figures whereas u s corporations in europe between and invested billion and made billion in profits in latin america they invested billion and made billion in profits and in africa they invested billion and made billion in profits it was the classical imperial situation where the places with natural wealth became victims of more powerful nations whose power came from that seized wealth american corporations depended on the poorer countries for percent of their diamonds coffee platinum mercury natural rubber and cobalt they got percent of their manganese from abroad percent of their chrome and aluminum and to percent of certain imports platinum mercury cobalt chrome manganese came from africa another fundamental of foreign policy whether democrats or republicans were in the white house was the training of foreign military officers the army had a school of the americas in the canal zone from which thousands of military leaders in latin america had graduated six of the graduates for instance were in the chilean military junta that overthrew the democratically elected allende government in the american commandant of the school told a reporter we keep in touch with our graduates and they keep in touch with us and yet the united states cultivated a reputation for being generous with its riches indeed it had frequently given aid to disaster victims this aid however often depended on political loyalty in one six year drought in west africa africans died of starvation a report by the carnegie endowment said the agency for international development aid of the united states had been inefficient and neglectful in giving aid to nomads in the sahel area of west africa an area covering six countries the response of aid was that those countries had no close historical economic or political ties to the united states in early the press carried a dispatch from washington secretary of state henry a kissinger has formally initiated a policy of selecting for cutbacks in american aid those nations that have sided against the u s in votes in the united nations in some cases the cutbacks involve food and humanitarian relief most aid was openly military and by the united states exported billion in arms the carter administration promised to end the sale of arms to repressive regimes but when it took office the bulk of the sales continued and the military continued to take a huge share of the national budget when carter was running for election he told the democratic platform committee without endangering the defense of our nation or commitments to our allies we can reduce present defense expenditures by about to billion dollars annually but his first budget proposed not a decrease but an increase of billion for the military indeed he proposed that the u s spend a thousand billion dollars a trillion dollars in the next five years on its military forces and the administration had just announced that the department of agriculture would save million a year by no longer giving free second helpings of milk to million needy schoolchildren who got free meals in school if carter s job was to restore faith in the system here was his greatest failure solving the economic problems of the people the price of food and the necessities of life continued to rise faster than wages were rising unemployment remained officially at or percent unofficially the rates were higher for certain key groups in the population young people and especially young black people the unemployment rate was or percent it soon became clear that blacks in the united states the group most in support of carter for president were bitterly disappointed with his policies he opposed federal aid to poor people who needed abortions and when it was pointed out to him that this was unfair because rich women could get abortions with ease he replied well as you know there are many things in life that are not fair that wealthy people can afford and poor people cannot carter s populism was not visible in his administration s relationship to the oil and gas interests it was part of carter s energy plan to end price regulation of natural gas for the consumer the largest producer of natural gas was exxon corporation and the largest blocs of private stock in exxon were owned by the rockefeller family early in carter s administration the federal energy administration found that gulf oil corporation had overstated by million its costs for crude oil obtained from foreign affiliates it then passed on these false costs to consumers in the summer of the administration announced that a compromise had been made with gulf oil in which gulf agreed to pay back million gulf informed its stockholders that the payments will not affect earnings since adequate provision was made in prior years the lawyer for the energy department who worked out the compromise with gulf said it had been done to avoid a lengthy and costly lawsuit would the lawsuit have cost the million dropped in the compromise would the government have considered letting off a bank robber without a jail term in return for half the loot the settlement was a perfect example of what carter had told a meeting of lawyers during his presidential campaign that the law was on the side of the rich the fundamental facts of maldistribution of wealth in america were clearly not going to be affected by carter s policies any more than by previous administrations whether conservative or liberal according to andrew zimbalist an american economist writing in le monde diplomatique in the top percent of the american population had an income thirty times that of the bottom tenth the top percent of the nation owned percent of the wealth the richest percent owned percent of the personally owned corporate stock the one hundred largest corporations despite the graduated income tax that misled people into thinking the very rich paid at least percent in taxes paid an average of percent in taxes and the leading oil companies paid percent in taxes internal revenue service figures for indeed individuals who earned over paid no taxes in as carter weakly proposed benefits for the poor and congress strongly turned them down a black woman marian wright edelman director of the children s defense fund in washington pointed to some facts one of every seven american children million altogether had no known regular source of primary health care one of every three children under seventeen million altogether had never seen a dentist in an article on the new york times op ed page she wrote the senate budget committee recently knocked off million from a modest million administration request to improve the program that screens and treats children s health problems at the same time the senate found million to bail out litton industries and to hand to the navy at least two destroyers ordered by the shah of iran carter approved tax reforms which benefited mainly the corporations economist robert lekachman writing in the nation noted the sharp increase in corporate profits percent in the last quarter of over the previous year s last quarter he wrote perhaps the president s most outrageous act occurred last november when he signed into law an billion tax reduction the bulk of whose benefits accrue to affluent individuals and corporations in while the poor were taking cuts the salary of the chairman of exxon oil was being raised to a year and that of the chairman of mobil oil to over a million dollars a year that year while exxon s net income rose percent to more than billion three thousand small independent gasoline stations went out of business carter made some efforts to hold onto social programs but this was undermined by his very large military budgets presumably this was to guard against the soviet union but when the soviet union invaded afghanistan in carter could take only symbolic actions like reinstituting the draft or calling for a boycott of the moscow olympics on the other hand american weaponry was used to support dictatorial regimes battling left wing rebels abroad a report by the carter administration to congress in was blunt saying that a number of countries with deplorable records of human rights observance are also countries where we have important security and foreign policy interests thus carter asked congress in the spring of for million in credits for the military junta fighting off a peasant rebellion in el salvador in the philippines after the national assembly elections president ferdinand marcos imprisoned ten of the twenty one losing opposition candidates many prisoners were tortured many civilians were killed still carter urged congress to give marcos million in military aid for the next five years in nicaragua the united states had helped maintain the somoza dictatorship for decades misreading the basic weakness of that regime and the popularity of the revolution against it the carter administration continued its support for somoza until close to the regime s fall in in iran toward the end of the long years of resentment against the shah s dictatorship culminated in mass demonstrations on september hundreds of demonstrators were massacred by the shah s troops the next day according to a upi dispatch from teheran carter affirmed his support for the shah troops opened fire on demonstrators against the shah for the third straight day yesterday and president jimmy carter telephoned the royal palace to express support for shah mohammad reza pahlevi who faced the worst crisis of his year reign nine members of parliament walked out on a speech by iran s new premier shouting that his hands were stained with blood in the crackdown on conservative moslems and other protesters on december nicholas gage reported for the new york times the staff of the united states embassy here has been bolstered by dozens of specialists flown in to back an effort to help the shah against a growing challenge to his rule according to embassy sources the new arrivals according to the embassy sources include a number of central intelligence agency specialists on iran in addition to diplomats and military personnel in early as the crisis in iran was intensifying the former chief analyst on iran for the cia told new york times reporter seymour hersh that he and his colleagues knew of the tortures of iranian dissenters by savaki the iranian secret police set up during the late s by the shah with help from the cia furthermore he told hersh that a senior cia official was involved in instructing officials in savaki on torture techniques it was a popular massive revolution and the shah fled the carter administration later accepted him into the country presumably for medical treatment and the anti american feelings of the revolutionaries reached a high point on november the u s embassy in teheran was taken over by student militants who demanding that the shah be returned to iran for punishment held fifty two embassy employees hostage for the next fourteen months with the hostages still held in the embassy compound that issue took the forefront of foreign news in the united states and aroused powerful nationalist feelings when carter ordered the immigration and naturalization service to start deportation proceedings against iranian students who lacked valid visas the new york times gave cautious but clear approval politicians and the press played into a general hysteria an iranian american girl who was slated to give a high school commencement address was removed from the program the bumper sticker bomb iran appeared on autos all over the country it was a rare journalist bold enough to point out as alan richman of the boston globe did when the fifty two hostages were released alive and apparently well that there was a certain lack of proportion in american reactions to this and other violations of human rights there were of them a number easy to comprehend it wasn t like innocent people permanently disappearing in argentina they the american hostages spoke our language there were people summarily shot in guatemala last year who did not the hostages were still in captivity when jimmy carter faced ronald reagan in the election of that fact and the economic distress felt by many were largely responsible for carter s defeat reagan s victory followed eight years later by the election of george bush meant that another part of the establishment lacking even the faint liberalism of the carter presidency would be in charge the policies would be more crass cutting benefits to poor people lowering taxes for the wealthy increasing the military budget filling the federal court system with conservative judges actively working to destroy revolutionary movements in the caribbean the dozen years of the reagan bush presidency transformed the federal judiciary never more than moderately liberal into a predominantly conservative institution by the fall of reagan and bush had filled more than half of the federal judgeships and appointed enough right wing justices to transform the supreme court in the seventies with liberal justices william brennan and thurgood marshall in the lead the court had declared death penalties unconstitutional had supported in roe v wade the right of women to choose abortions and had interpreted the civil rights law as permitting special attention to blacks and women to make up for past discrimination affirmative action william rehnquist first named to the supreme court by richard nixon was made chief justice by ronald reagan in the reagan bush years the rehnquist court made a series of decisions that weakened roe v wade brought back the death penalty reduced the rights of detainees against police powers prevented doctors in federally supported family planning clinics from giving women information on abortions and said that poor people could be forced to pay for public education education was not a fundamental right justices william brennan and thurgood marshall were the last of the court s liberals old and ill though reluctant to give up the fight they retired the final act to create a conservative supreme court was president bush s nomination to replace marshall he chose a black conservative clarence thomas despite dramatic testimony from a former colleague a young black law professor named anita hill that thomas had sexually harassed her thomas was approved by the senate and now the supreme court moved even more decisively to the right with conservative federal judges with pro business appointments to the national labor relations board judicial decisions and board findings weakened a labor movement already troubled by a decline in manufacturing workers who went out on strike found themselves with no legal protection one of the first acts of the reagan administration was to dismiss from their jobs en masse striking air traffic controllers it was a warning to future strikers and a sign of the weakness of a labor movement which in the thirties and forties had been a powerful force corporate america became the greatest beneficiary of the reagan bush years in the sixties and seventies an important environmental movement had grown in the nation horrified at the poisoning of the air the seas and rivers and the deaths of thousands each year as a result of work conditions after a mine explosion in west virginia killed seventy eight miners in november there had been angry protest in the mine district and congress passed the coal mine health and safety act of nixon s secretary of labor spoke of a new national passion passion for environmental improvement the following year yielding to strong demands from the labor movement and consumer groups but also seeing it as an opportunity to win the support of working class voters president nixon had signed the occupational safety and health act of this was an important piece of legislation establishing a universal right to a safe and healthy workplace and creating an enforcement machinery reflecting on this years later herbert stein who had been the chairman of nixon s council of economic advisers lamented that the juggernaut of environmental regulation proved not to be controllable by the nixon administration while

first acts was to order the destruction of government booklets pointing out the dangers of cotton dust to textile workers political scientist william grover the president as prisoner evaluating environmental policy under carter and reagan as part of his penetrating structural critique of both presidents concluded osha appears caught in a cycle of liberal presidents who want to retain some health and safely regulatory programs but who also need economic growth for political survival and conservative presidents who focus almost exclusively on the growth side of the equation such a cycle will always tend to subordinate the need for safe and healthful workplaces to ensuring that commitment to osha will only be as strong as the priorities of business will allow george bush presented

of a new world called the blazing world lyricsto all noble and worthy ladies this present description of a new world was made as an appendix to my observations upon experimental philosophy and having some sympathy and coherence with each other were joined together as two several worlds at their two poles but by reason most ladies take no delight in philosophical arguments i separated some from the mentioned observations and caused them to go out by themselves that i might express my respects in presenting to them such fancies as my contemplations did afford the first part is romancical the second philosophical and the third is merely fancy or as i may call it fantastical and if noble ladies you should chance to take pleasure in reading these fancies i shall account myself a happy creatoress if not i must be content to live a melancholy life in my own world which i cannot call a poor world if poverty be only want of gold and jewels for there is more gold in it than all the chymists ever made or as i verily believe will ever be able to make as for the rocks of diamonds i wish with all my soul they might be shared amongst my noble female friends upon which condition i would willingly quit my part and of the gold i should desire only so much as might suffice to repair my noble lord and husband s losses for i am not covetous but as ambitious as ever any of my sex was is or can be which is the cause that though i cannot be henry the fifth or charles the second yet i will endeavor to be margaret the first and though i have neither power time nor occasion to be a great conqueror like alexander or cesar yet rather than not be mistress of a world since fortune and the fates would give me none i have made one of my own and thus believing or at least hoping that no creature can or will envy me for this world of mine i remain noble ladies your humble servant m newcastle the description of a new world called the blazing world a merchant travelling into a foreign country fell extremely in love with a young lady but being a stranger in that nation and beneath her both in birth and wealth he could have but little hopes of obtaining his desire however his love growing more and more vehement upon him even to the slighting of all difficulties he resolved at last to steal her away which he had the better opportunity to do because her father s house was not far from the sea and she often using to gather shells upon the shore accompanied not with above two to three of her servants it encouraged him the more to execute his design thus coming one time with a little light vessel not unlike a packet boat manned with some few sea men and well victual led for fear of some accidents which might perhaps retard their journey to the place where she used to repair he forced her away but when he fancied himself the happiest man of the world he proved to be the most unfortunate for heaven frowning at his theft raised such a tempest as they knew not what to do or whether to steer their course so that the vessel both by its own lightness and the violent motion of the wind was carried as swift as an arrow out of a bow towards the north pole and in a short time reached the icy sea where the wind forced it amongst huge pieces of ice but being little and light it did by the assistance and favour of the gods to this virtuous lady so turn and wind through those precipices as if it had been guided by some experienced pilot and skillful mariner but alas those few men which were in it not knowing whether they went nor what was to be done in so strange an adventure and not being provided for so cold a voyage were all frozen to death the young lady only by the light of her beauty the heat of her youth and protection of the gods remaining alive neither was it a wonder that the men did freeze to death for they were not only driven to the very end or point of the pole of that world but even to another pole of another world which joined close to it so that the cold having a double strength at the conjunction of those two poles was insupportable at last the boat still passing on was forced into another world for it is impossible to round this world s globe from pole to pole so as we do from east to west because the poles of the other world joining to the poles of this do not allow any further passage to surround the world that way but if any one arrives to either of these poles he is either forced to return or to enter into another world and lest you should scruple at it and think if it were thus those that live at the poles would either see two suns at one time or else they would never want the sun s light for six months together as it is commonly believed you must know that each of these worlds having its own sun to enlighten it they move each one in their peculiar circles which motion is so just and exact that neither can hinder or obstruct the other for they do not exceed their tropics and although they should meet yet we in this world cannot so well perceive them by reason of the brightness of our sun which being nearer to us obstructs the splendor of the sun of the other world they being too far off to be discerned by our optic perception except we use very good telescopes by which skillful astronomers have often observed two or three suns at once but to return to the wandering boat and the distressed lady she seeing all the men dead found small comfort in life their bodies which were preserved all that while from putrefaction and stench by the extremity of cold began now to thaw and corrupt whereupon she having not strength enough to fling them over board was forced to remove out of her small cabine upon the deck to avoid the nauseous smell and finding the boat swim between two plains of ice as a stream that runs betwixt two shores at last perceived land but covered all with snow from which came walking upon the ice strange creatures in shape like bears only they went upright as men those creatures coming near the boat catches hold of it with their paws that served them instead of hands some two or three of them entered first and when they came out the rest went in one after another at last having viewed and observed all that was in the boat they spake to each other in a language which the lady did not understand and having carried her out of the boat sunk it together with the dead men the lady now finding her self in so strange a place and amongst such wonderful kind of creatures was extreamly strucken with fear and could entertain no other thoughts but that every moment her life was to be a sacrifice to their cruelty but those bear like creatures how terrible soever they appear d to her sight yet were they so far from exercising any cruelty upon her that rather they shewed her all civility and kindness imaginable for she being not able to go upon the ice by reason of its slipperiness they took her up in their rough arms and carried her into their city where instead of houses they had caves under ground and as soon as they enter d the city both males and females young and old flock together to see this lady holding up their paws in admiration at last having brought her into a certain large and spacious cave which they intended for her reception they left her to the custody of the females who entertained her with all kindness and respect and gave her such victuals as they used to eat but seeing her constitution neither agreed with the temper of that climate nor their diet they were resolved to carry her into another island of a warmer temper in which were men like foxes onely walking in an upright shape who received their neighbors the bear men with great civility and courtship very much admiring this beauteous lady and having discoursed some while together agreed at last to make her a present to the emperor of their world to which end after she had made some short stay in the same place they brought her cross that island to a large river whose stream run smooth and clear like chrystal in which were numerous boats much like our fox traps in one whereof she was carried some of the bear and fox men waiting on her and as soon as they had crossed the river they came into an island where there were men which had heads beaks and feathers like wild geese only they went in an upright shape like the bear men and fox men their rumps they carried between their legs their wings were of the same length with their bodies and their tails of an indifferent size trailing after them like a ladie s garment and after the bear and fox men had declared their intention and design to their neighbors the geese or bird men some of them joined to the rest and attended the lady through that island till they came to another great and large river where there was a preparation made of many boats much like birds nests only of a bigger size and having crost that river they arrived into another island which was of a pleasant and mild temper full of woods and the inhabitants thereof were satyrs who received both the bear fox and bird men with all respect and civility and after some conferences for they all understood each others language some chief of the satyrs joining to them accompanied the lady out of that island to another river wherein were many handsome and commodious barges and having crost that river they entered into a large and spacious kingdom the men whereof were of a grass green complexion who entertained them very kindly and provided all conveniences for their further voyage hitherto they had only crost rivers but now they could not avoid the open seas any longer wherefore they made their ships and tacklings ready to sail over into the island where the emperor of the blazing world for so it was call d kept his residence very good navigators they were and though they had no knowledge of the load stone or needle or pendulous watches yet which was as serviceable to them they had subtile observations and great practice in so much that they could not onely tell the depth of the sea in every place but where there were shelves of sand rocks and other obstructions to be avoided by skillful and experienced sea men besides they were excellent augurers which skill they counted more necessary and beneficial then the use of compasses cards watches and the like but above the rest they had an extraordinary art much to be taken notice of by experimental philosophers and that was a certain engin which would draw in a great quantity of air and shoot forth wind with a great force this engine in a calm they placed behind their ships and in a storm before for it served against the raging waves like cannons against an hostile army or besieged town it would batter and beat the waves in pieces were they as high as steeples and as soon as a breach was made they forced their passage through in spit even of the most furious wind using two of those engins at every ship one before to beat off the waves and another behind to drive it on so that the artificial wind had the better of the natural for it had a greater advantage of the waves then the natural of the ships the natural being above the face of the water could not without a down right motion enter or press into the ships whereas the artificial with a sideward motion did pierce into the bowels of the waves moreover it is to be observed that in a great tempest they would join their ships in battle aray and when they feared wind and waves would be too strong for them if they divided their ships they joined as many together as the compass or advantage of the places of the liquid element would give them leave for their ships were so ingeniously contrived that they could fasten them together as close as a honey comb without waste of place and being thus united no wind nor waves were able to separate them the emperor s ships were all of gold but the merchants and skippers of leather the golden ships were not much heavier then ours of wood by reason they were neatly made and required not such thickness neither were they troubled with pitch tar pumps guns and the like which make our woodden ships very heavy for though they were not all of a piece yet they were so well sodder d that there was no fear of leaks chinks or clefts and as for guns there was no use of them because they had no other enemies but the winds but the leather ships were not altogether so sure although much leighter besides they were pitched to keep out water having thus prepared and order d their navy they went on in despite of calm or storm and though the lady at first fancied her self in a very sad condition and her mind was much tormented with doubts and fears not knowing whether this strange adventure would tend to her safety or destruction yet she being withal of a generous spirit and ready wit considering what dangers she had past and finding those sorts of men civil and diligent attendants to her took courage and endeavoured to learn their language which after she had obtained so far that partly by some words and signs she was able to apprehend their meaning she was so far from being afraid of them that she thought her self not only safe but very happy in their company by which we may see that novelty discomposes the mind but acquaintance settles it in peace and tranquility at last having passed by several rich islands and kingdoms they went towards paradise which was the seat of the emperor and coming in sight of it rejoiced very much the lady at first could perceive nothing but high rocks which seemed to touch the skies and although they appear d not of an equal heigth yet they seemed to be all one piece without partitions but at last drawing nearer she perceived a clift which was a part of those rocks out of which she spied coming forth a great number of boats which afar off shewed like a company of ants marching one after another the boats appeared like the holes or partitions in a honey comb and when joined together stood as close the men were of several complexions but none like any of our world and when both the boats and ships met they saluted and spake to each other very courteously for there was but one language in all that world nor no more but one emperor to whom they all submitted with the greatest duty and obedience which made them live in a continued peace and happiness not acquainted with foreign wars or home bred insurrections the lady now being arrived at this place was carried out of her ship into one of those boats and conveighed through the same passage for there was no other into that part of the world where the emperor did reside which part was very pleasant and of a mild temper within it self it was divided by a great number of vast and large rivers all ebbing and flowing into several islands of unequal distance from each other which in most parts were as pleasant healthful rich and fruitful as nature could make them and as i mentioned before secure from all foreign invasions by reason there was but one way to enter and that like a labyrinth so winding and turning among the rocks that no other vessels but small boats could pass carrying not above three passengers at a time on each side all along the narrow and winding river there were several cities some of marble some of alabaster some of agat some of amber some of coral and some of other precious materials not known in our world all which after the lady had passed she came to the imperial city named paradise which appeared in form like several islands for rivers did run betwixt every street which together with the bridges whereof there was a great number were all paved the city it self was built of gold and their architectures were noble stately and magnificent not like our modern but like those in the romans time for our modern buildings are like those houses which children use to make of cards one story above another fitter for birds then men but theirs were more large and broad then high the highest of them did not exceed two stories besides those rooms that were under ground as cellars and other offices the emperor s palace stood upon an indifferent ascent from the imperial city at the top of which ascent was a broad arch supported by several pillars which went round the palace and contained four of our english miles in compass within the arch stood the emperor s guard which consisted of several sorts of men at every half mile was a gate to enter and every gate was of a different fashion the first which allowed a passage from the imperial city into the palace had on either hand a cloyster the outward part whereof stood upon arches sustained by pillars but the inner part was close being entered through the gate the palace it self appear d in its middle like the isle of a church a mile and a half long and half a mile broad the roof of it was all arched and rested upon pillars so artificially placed that a stranger would lose himself therein without a guide at the extreme sides that is between the outward and inward part of the cloyster were lodgings for attendants and in the midst of the palace the emperor s own rooms whose lights were placed at the top of every one because of the heat of the sun the emperor s apartment for state was no more enclosed then the rest only an imperial throne was in every apartment of which the several adornments could not be perceived until one entered because the pillars were so just opposite to one another that all the adornments could not be seen at one the first part of the palace was as the imperial city all of gold and when it came to the emperors appartment it was so rich with diamonds pearls rubies and the like precious stones that it surpasses my skill to enumerate them all amongst the rest the imperial room of state appear d most magnificent it was paved with green diamonds for there are in that world diamonds of all colors so artificially as it seemed but of one piece the pillars were set with diamonds so close and in such a manner that they appeared most glorious to the sight between every pillar was a bow or arch of a certain sort of diamonds the like whereof our world does not afford which being placed in every one of the arches in several rows seemed just like so many rain bows of several different colours the roof of the arches was of blew diamonds and in the midst thereof was a carbuncle which represented the sun and the rising and setting sun at the east and west side of the room were made of rubies out of this room there was a passage into the emperor s bed chamber the walls whereof were of jet and the floor of black marble the roof was of mother of pearl where the moon and blazing stars were represented by white diamonds and his bed was made of diamonds and carbuncles no sooner was the lady brought before the emperor but he conceived her to be some goddess and offered to worship her which she refused telling him for by that time she had pretty well learned their language that although she came out of another world yet was she but a mortal at which the emperor rejoycing made her his wife and gave her an absolute power to rule and govern all that world as she pleased but her subjects who could hardly be perswaded to believe her mortal tender d her all the veneration and worship due to a deity her accouterments after she was made empress was as follower on her head she wore a cap of pearl and a half moon of diamonds just before it on the top of her crown came spreading over a broad carbuncle cut in the form of the sun her coat was of pearl mixt with blew diamonds and fringed with red ones her buskins and sandals were of green diamonds in her left hand she held a buckler to signifies the defence of her dominions which buckler was made of that sort of diamond as has several different colors and being cut and made in the form of an arch shewed like a rain bow in her right hand she carried a spear made of white diamond cut like the tail of a blazing star which signified that she was ready to assault those that proved her enemies none was allowed to use or wear gold but those of the imperial race which were the onely nobles of the state nor durst any one wear jewels but the emperor the empress and their eldest son notwithstanding that they had an infinite quantity both of gold and precious stones in that world for they had larger extents of gold then our arabian sands their precious stones were rocks and their diamonds of several colors they used no coyn but all their traffick was by exchange of several commodities their priests and governors were princes of the imperial blood and made eunuches for that purpose and as for the ordinary sort of men in that part of the world where the emperor resided they were of several complexions not white black tawny olive or ash colored but some appear d of an azure some of a deep purple some of a grass green some of a scarlet some of an orange color c which colors and complexions whether they were made by the bare reflection of light without the assistance of small particles or by the help of well ranged and order d atoms or by a continual agitation of little globules or by some pressing and re acting motion i am not able to determine the rest of the inhabitants of that world were men of several different sorts shapes figures dispositions and humors as i have already made mention heretofore some were bear men some worm men some fish or mear men otherwise called syrens some bird men some fly men some ant men some geese men some spider men some lice men some fox men some ape men some jack daw men some magpie men some parrot men some satyrs some gyants and many more which i cannot all remember and of these several sorts of men each followed such a profession as was most proper for the nature of their species which the empress encouraged them in especially those that had applied themselves to the study of several arts and sciences for they were as ingenious and witty in the invention of profitable and useful arts as we are in our world nay more and to that end she erected schools and founded several societies the bear men were to be her experimental philosophers the bird men her astronomers the fly worm and fish men her natural philosophers the ape men her chemists the satyrs her galenick physicians the fox men her politicians the spider and lice men her mathematicians the jackdaw magpie and parrot men her orators and logicians the gyants her architects c but before all things she having got a sovereign power from the emperor over all the world desired to be informed both of the manner of their religion and government and to that end she called the priests and states men to give her an account of either of the states men she inquired first why they had so few laws to which they answered that many laws made many divisions which most commonly did breed factions and at last brake out into open wars next she asked why they preferred the monarchical form of government before any other they answered that as it was natural for one body to have but one head so it was also natural for a politic body to have but one governor and that a common wealth which had many governors was like a monster with many heads besides said they a monarchy is a divine form of government and agrees most with our religion for as there is but one god whom we all unanimously worship and adore with one faith so we are resolved to have but one emperor to whom we all submit with one obedience then the empress seeing that the several sorts of her subjects had each their churches apart asked the priests whether they were of several religions they answered her majesty that there was no more but one religion in all that world nor no diversity of opinions in that same religion for though there were several sorts of men yet had they all but one opinion concerning the worship and adoration of god the empress asked them whether they were jews turks or christians we do not know said they what religions those are but we do all unanimously acknowledge worship and adore the onely omnipotent and eternal god with all reverence submission and duty again the empress inquired whether they had several forms of worship they answered no for our devotion and worship consists only in prayers which we frame according to our several necessities in petitions humiliations thanksgiving c truly replied the empress i thought you had been either jews or turks because i never perceived any women in your congregations but what is the reason you bar them from your religious assemblies it is not fit said they that men and women should be promiscuously together in time of religious worship for their company hinders devotion and makes many instead of praying to god direct their devotion to their mistresses but asked the empress have they no congregation of their own to perform the duties of divine worship as well as men no answered they but they stay at home and say their prayers by themselves in their closets then the empress desired to know the reason why the priests and governors of their world were made eunuchs they answer d to keep them from marriage for women and children most commonly make disturbance both in church and state but said she women and children have no employment in church or state tis true answer d they but although they are not admitted to publick employments yet are they so prevalent with their husbands and parents that many times by their importunate persuasions they cause as much nay more mischief secretly then if they had the management of public affairs the empress having received an information of what concerned both church and state passed some time in viewing the imperial palace where she admired much the skill and ingenuity of the architects and inquired of them first why they built their houses no higher then two stories from the ground they answered her majesty that the lower their buildings were the less were they subject either to the heat of the sun or wind tempest decay c then she desired to know the reason why they made them so thick they answered that the thicker the walls were the warmer they were in winter the cooler in summer for their thickness kept out both the cold and heat lastly she asked why they arched their roofs and made so many pillars they replied that arches and pillars did not onely grace a building very much and caused it to appear magnificent but made it also firm and lasting the empress was very well satisfied with their answers and after some time when she thought that her new founded societies of the vertuoso s had made a good progress in the several employments she had put them upon she caused a convocation first of the bird men and commanded them to give her a true relation of the two celestial bodies viz the sun and moon which they did with all the obedience and faithfulness befitting their duty the sun as much as they could observe they related to be a firm or solid stone of a vast bigness of color yellowish and of an extraordinary splendor but the moon they said was of a whitish color and although she looked dim in the presence of the sun yet had she her own light and was a shining body of her self as might be perceived by her vigorous appearance in moon shiny nights the difference only betwixt her own and the sun s light was that the sun did strike his beams in a direct line but the moon never respected the centre of their world in a right line but her center was always eccentrically the spots both in the sun and moon as far as they were able to perceive they affirmed to be nothing else but flaws and stains of their stony bodies concerning the heat of the sun they were not of one opinion some would have the sun hot in it self alleging an old tradition that it should at some time break asunder and burn the heavens and consume this world into hot embers which said they could not be done if the sun were not fiery of it self others again said this opinion could not stand with reason for fire being a destroyer of all things the sun stone after this manner would burn up all the near adjoining bodies besides said they fire cannot subsist without fuel and the sun stone having nothing to feed on would in a short time consume it self wherefore they thought it more probable that the sun was not actually hot but only by the reflection of its light so that its heat was an effect of its light both being immaterial but this opinion again was laugh at by others and rejected as ridiculous who thought it impossible that one immaterial should produce another and believed that both the light and heat of the sun proceeded from a swift circular motion of the ethereal globules which by their striking upon the optic nerve caused light and their motion produced heat but neither would this opinion hold for said some then it would follow that the sight of animals is the cause of light and that were there no eyes there would be no light which was against all sense and reason thus they argued concerning the heat and light of the sun but which is remarkable none did say that the sun was a globules fluid body and had a swift circular motion but all agreed it was fixt and firm like a center and therefore they generally called it the sun stone then the empress asked them the reason why the sun and moon did often appear in different postures or shapes as sometimes magnified sometimes diminished sometimes elevated other whiles depressed now thrown to the right and then to the left to which some of the bird men answered that it proceeded from the various degrees of heat and cold which are found in the air from whence did follow a differing density and rarity and likewise from the vapors that are interposed whereof those that ascend are higher and less dense then the ambient air but those which descend are heavier and more dense but others did with more probability affirm that it was nothing else but the various patterns of the air for like as painters do not copy out one and the same original just alike at all times so said they do several parts of the air make different patterns of the luminous bodies of the sun and moon which patterns as several copies the sensitive motions do figure out in the substance of our eyes this answer the empress liked much better then the former and enquired further what opinion they had of those creatures that are called the motes of the sun to which they answered that they were nothing else but streams of very small rare and transparent particles through which the sun was represented as through a glass for if they were not transparent said they they would eclipse the light of the sun and if not rare and of an airy substance they would hinder flies from flying in the air at least retard their flying motion nevertheless although they were thinner then the thinnest vapour yet were they not so thin as the body of air or else they would not be perceptible by animal sight then the empress asked whether they were living creatures they answered yes because they did encrease and decrease and were nourished by the presence and starved by the absence of the sun having thus finished their discourse of the sun and moon the empress desired to know what stars there were besides but they answer d that they could perceive in that world none other but blazing stars and from thence it had the name that it was called the blazing world and these blazing stars said they were such solid firm and shining bodies as the sun and moon not of a globular but of several sorts of figures some had tails and some other kinds of shapes after this the empress asked them what kind of substance or creature the air was the bird men answered that they could have no other perception of the air but by their own respiration for said they some bodies are only subject to touch others only to sight and others only to smell but some are subject to none of our exterior senses for nature is so full of variety that our weak senses cannot perceive all the various sorts of her creatures neither is there any one object perceptible by all our senses no more then several objects are by one sense i believe you replied the empress but if you can give no account of the air said she you will hardly be able to inform me how wind is made for they say that wind is nothing but motion of the air the bird men answer d that they observed wind to be more dense then air and therefore subject to the sense of touch but what properly wind was and the manner how it was made they could not exactly tell some said it was caused by the clouds falling on each other and others that it was produced of a hot and dry exhalation which ascending was driven down again by the coldness of the air that is in the middle region and by reason of its lightness could not go directly to the bottom but was carried by the air up and down ,"['enlighten', 'flow', 'laugh', 'absolute', 'scruple', 'kindness', 'fluid', 'eclipse', 'colored', 'race', 'philosophical', 'ape', 'salute', 'glorious', 'mile',

playing in simba s head like an echo in a cave i killed mufasa i killed mufasa when he looked up at the triumphant grin on scar s face he now knew that it was the truth he wasn t guilty after all he hadn t caused mufasa s death it was scar who had done it he had a chance to save his own brother from the fall but instead he let him fall that or shoved him down either way it was scar who killed mufasa all of this was on him despair was now replaced by a fiery rage and he now felt hatred for the uncl whom he had once been friendly with as scar croon d goodnight sweet prince and prepared to shove him down to the fire simba acted just in time he roared loudly and surged upward to grab his uncle by the mane with his teeth catching scar off guard the older lion awkwardly pulled backwards and ended up pulling simba back up which resulted in simba lunging and pinning scar to the rock causing gasps of surprise to come from the lionesses hyenas swarmed over to protect their leader from the younger lion waiting with the lionesses to see what would happen next suddenly there was a tremendous terrible baying of jackals and a shrill crowing from the black cockerel murderer simba roared his paws pinning scar down he was my father your flesh and blood how could you scar gasped and struggled under simba s weight there you see first he kills mufasa and now he wants to kill me murderer simba screamed a second time tell them the truth don t believe his lies scar roared in anger then sarabi stepped forward her disappointment in scar for nearly flinging her son off of pride rock was now replaced by anger scar you told us that you didn t get to the gorge in time she growled scar gulped yes that s true then how did you see the fear in mufasa s eyes sarabi pressed on with a snarl something hadn t felt right to sarabi there was no way that scar had seen the fear in mufasa s eyes when he said that he hadn t gotten to the gorge in time and when she overheard scar saying saw the fear in his eyes it had made her even more suspicious you heard her scar tell them the truth simba snarled or should i do it truth scar simpered with a sickening smarmy smile but truth is in the eye of the beho but he was cut off as simba slammed a paw down hard on his throat making him choke a all right all right i did it i admit it so they can hear you spat simba with deep hatred burning in his eyes scar roared i killed mufasa simba got off of him while the skinnier lion tried to slip away but all that met him were the faces of angry lionesses he was caught everything scar had told them and simba was a lie he was the reason why simba ran away from home why the pride lands were in ruins and why mufasa was dead you traitor sarabi said in red anger pure anger and sorrow on her face i guessed there was something behind mufasa s death but i never thought you were the actual one behind it you were never fit to be king let alone deserving of the title of king mufasa was always twice the king you were and you murdered him for it scar backed away watching as the lionesses and other animals started moving toward him he and simba glared at each other simba s body pulsing with rage and triumph near the pridelands without fire loud laughter and bursts of singing came from the marriott hotel and suddenly at the sound of the mingled voices the lionesses were stricken with curiosity what could be happening in there now that for the first time animals and human beings were meeting on terms of equality with one accord they began to creep as quietly as possible into the savannah at the gate they paused half frightened to go on but one of the lionesses led the way in they tiptoed up to the hotel and such lionesses as were tall enough like giraffes and cheetahs peered in at the hotel window there round the long table sat half a dozen girls and half a dozen of the more eminent jackals marabous polar bears and vultures serena herself occupying the seat of honor at the head of the table the polar bears appeared completely at ease in their chairs the company had been enjoying eating waffles syrup pancakes and steak but had broken off for the moment evidently in order to drink a toast iris had stood up with her sprite in her hand in a moment i would ask you girls polar bears marabous jackals and vultures to drink a toast she announced but before doing so there were a few words that she felt it incumbent upon her to say there had been a time not that we or any of the present company had shared such sentiments but there had been a time when the respected proprietors of george s wild animal kingdom had been regarded i would not say with hostility but perhaps with a certain measure of misgiving by our penguins unfortunate incidents had occurred and mistaken ideas had been current it had been felt that the existence of a zoo owned and operated by construction builders was somehow abnormal and was liable to have an unsettling effect on the neighborhood too many polar bears had assumed without due inquiry that in such a zoo a spirit of license and indiscipline would prevail they had been nervous about the effects upon our own animals including cheetahs leopards ostriches and sea lions and even upon their human employees but all such doubts were now dispelled today i and my friends already met simba visited george s wild animal kingdom and inspected every inch of it with our own eyes and what did we find not only the most up to date methods but a discipline and an orderliness which should be an example to all of you in our hotel iris serena valerie and kyururu got many ideas in which order to drink a toast during which the polar bear s various chins turned white but she managed to get it out if you have your lower animals to contend with she said we have our lower classes this bon mot set the table in a roar of laughter and iris once again congratulated the girls polar bears marabous vultures the black cockerel and jackals on the low rations the long working hours and the general absence of pampering which she had observed on george s wild animal kingdom and now iris said finally i would like you to rise to your feet and make certain that your glasses were full guys concluded iris guys i give you a toast to the prosperity of george s wild animal kingdom but then a sickening smile came across scar s face scar heard iris s speech from the hotel looking behind him he turned to his hyena army and roared kill them all that was when it all erupted into chaos there was enthusiastic cheering and stamping of feet coming from the lionesses girls polar bears jackals marabous the black cockerel and vultures serena was so gratified that she left her place and came round the table to clink her sprite against iris s before emptying it when the cheering had died down serena who had remained on her feet intimated that she too had a few words to say meanwhile scar s hyena army surged forward charging at simba while scar slipped away with a roar simba swiped his claws at a few hyenas coming his way catching a few on their muzzles two had gotten around him and crunched down on his hind legs making him roar in pain and the rest of the hyenas charged and knocked simba down the lionesses now boldened and enraged by the truth lunged into battle biting and scratching as much hyenas as they could to make them release simba in moments all of pride rock was alive with the roars and cackles of battling lions and hyenas simba dove into the battle slashing at hyenas left and right to reach nala and sarabi who were back to back and holding their own they were going to pay the hyenas back for making their lives as hellish as possible the smoke from the fire filled the air and burned their lungs threatening to further weaken the lionesses but they had gotten their spirit and resolve back a small swarm of hyenas managed to dogpile simba trying to tear at his ears and throat simba was roaring in pure fury when a familiar stick swung down and swatted a hyena away when simba looked up he saw teenage tamino standing on a ledge screeching a battle cry and jumping down to join the battle she stared down the hyenas before kicking and chopping any that got close to her even backhanding one they shall not pass tamino told simba with a manic grin now go help your pride my king with a nod simba raced off to find more hyenas to fight as he ran he spotted nala biting into the spine of one hyena when another came rushing at her she realized that she was staring into the eyes of shenzi the leader of the entire hyena clan said the hyena ran over and sank her fangs into nala s shoulder while nala roared and kicked at shenzi s belly using her claws to strike back once the hyena let go nala sat down protecting the base of her spine in case the hyenas decided to paralyze her well lookie here looks like you ve come a long way girlie shenzi snickered stalking around nala this is a meal i ve been waitin years for you can try all you d like nala snarled back i ve waited for this moment too and i m not a cub anymore thus both the lioness and hyena rushed at each other simba realized that nala was indeed a superior fighter and let her fight knowing that she was very capable of defending herself meanwhile back at the hotel serena made a speech i had only one criticism she said to make of iris s excellent and neighborly speech iris had referred throughout to george s wild animal kingdom i could not of course know for i myself was only now for the first time announcing that the name george s wild animal kingdom had been abolished henceforward the animal theme park aviary aquarium and zoo was to be known as serena s wild animal kingdom which i believe was the zoo s correct and new name guys concluded serena i will give you the same toast as before george s wild animal kingdom but in a newer form fill your glasses to the brim guys here is my toast to the prosperity of my name of the zoo serena s wild animal kingdom there was the loudest roar of cheering like iris s speech from the polar bears the black cockerel marabous vultures jackals and the girls and the sprite were emptied to the dregs but as the lionesses outside gazed at the scene it seemed to them that some strange thing was happening what was it that had altered the faces of the polar bears one of the lioness s sharp keen eyes flitted from one face to another some of them had one chin some had two some had three some had four some had five some had six some had seven some have eight and some have nine but what was it that seemed to be melting and changing it was an uproar of voices and they were coming from the hotel the sea lions in their dolphin pool looked at the hotel yes a violent quarrel was in progress there were shoutings bangings on the table sharp suspicious glances and furious denials the source of the trouble appeared to be that serena iris kyururu dawn valerie and the polar bears had each fought against the sprite and other food as well twelve voices were shouting in anger and they were all alike no question now what had happened to the faces of the polar bears the sea lions in the dolphin pool looked from follower to minister and from minister to follower and from follower to minister again the sea lions heard a loud squawk coming from the sky it was zazu and the guineafowl for king and country zazu squawked in the air near the outside of the hotel swooping down on hyenas led by shenzi s minions he pecked furiously at azizi s head making him yelp and whine as he tried snapping at the hornbill next to him the guinea fowl divebombed any hyenas they could staying close to the rocks so that they wouldn t get eaten but kamari managed to finally swat zazu down until he hit the ground pretty hard earning him a cackle from azizi the guinea fowl squawked in alarm and fluttered down to assist the hornbill in doing that however they ended up being surrounded by the hyenas too gentlemen please zazu squawked backing into a corner with the guinea fowl can t we just talk this out like civilized animals soon after serena s speech the loudest ovation of clapping having come to an end as a reply to zazu the girls polar bears jackals marabous and vultures went outside of the hotel and started the blending in game that had been interrupted and the lionesses continued the fighting just before kamari could get his jaws on zazu bunga barreled into him knocking him away from zazu in spite of being outnumbered and smaller than them the honey badger kept snapping and biting at any hyenas that came closer he even slashed at a hyena s head with his claws before grabbing it and dropping down to the ground in a sitting position leaving the hyena reeling he wasn t alone bhati daabi and the antelope came running forward scratching and biting and butting anywhere they could even the elephant shrew and the galago jumped on their backs biting their ears and stomping on their heads we ll hold em off old timer bunga called to zazu you get to safety what i m gonna say is stupid but this battle is un bunga lievable what about you honey badger zazu asked will you be all right there are more hyenas than you bunga gave him a grin well i don t care he chuckled i don t give a darn we ll handle it from here so zazu and the fowl flapped away and the jungle animals continued their battle this was not relaxing at all to them but they had felt a fire in their hearts when they fought for the first time ever and once kamari and azizi had gotten enough pecked enough they ran off to find their leader and fight beside her another battle took place not far away from them timon was trying to keep out of biting range of pursuing hyenas led by banzai and ed he tried throwing rocks at them kicking dirt in their eyes and even tried insulting them with corny jokes the hyenas managed to chase him into a cave until he was backing up against a wildebeest ribcage i m begging ya timon gasped dramatically dropping to his knees please don t eat me problem a voice spoke from the cave entrance and everyone turned it was pumbaa hey who s the pig banzai chuckled suddenly pumbaa glared intensely at the hyenas unnerving them are you talkin to me uh oh you called him a pig timon muttered to the hyenas are you talkin to me shouldn t have done that are you talkin to me now you re in for it they call me iris interrupted pumbaa screamed like before joining the girls polar bears marabous jackals and vultures together in one gigantic voice the new overcomers then they charged with an ear splitting yaaaaaaaaaahh what happened next was mayhem pumbaa was tossing around hyenas with his tusks grunting and stabbing angrily timon was not far behind jumping up and grabbing one of banzai s ears with his teeth and he bit down until the hyena thrashed and tore away from him together the two friends chased the hyenas out of the cave and towards where the battle took place sheesh slow down will ya fatso banzai snapped panting again pumbaa seemed to bristle did he call me fat he asked timon timon nodded adding a very annoyed oi vey as he face palmed yeah i heard him timon he called me fat which is a big mistake pumbaa snorted pawing the ground let me tell you right now hyenas that only my friends can call me fat and only they can call me a pig i might run from hyenas but i ll always fight a bully with a yell he charged at the remaining hyenas tossing banzai and ed aside with his tusks and making the other hyenas retreat once those hyenas were backed into a corner the ground opened up with a crack and the hyenas went sliding down a tunnel created by the crumbling dirt thanks ma timon called down the tunnel thanks uncle max his mother and uncle climbed out ma giving him a rather bone crushing hug i m just glad we got to see you again timmy she replied with a smile i love you so much timon smiled weakly love ya too ma not breathing ma released her son and uncle max clapped a paw on timon s back a proud look on his face well tee moan he declared as he and timon exchanged smiles that stupid idea of yours wasn t stupid after all it really worked i m proud of you pumbaa walked over and let timon climb onto his back as he did timon declared you know i love the smell of pumbaa in the morning smells like victory got that out of your system buddy yep said pumbaa i feel a lot better good replied timon this is never gonna get old now let s go kick some bad pested hyenas with a double yell they charged toward the crowd of hyenas bowling and knocking more out of the way on that day they decided that bowling for hyenas was a much better game than catching the vultures the girls polar bears jackals marabous and vultures led by iris with her penguin and the black cockerel began forming a giant pteranodon flying around pride rock when the lionesses saw the giant pteranodon nala had left to fight alongside simba leaving sarabi briefly alone fortunately sarafina had noticed this and ran to help her friend in fighting some more hyenas they slashed and bit some more but just when sarafina was about to finish one off zira suddenly lunged out of the crowd and grabbed a hold of sarafina s pelt with her claws sarabi was not surprised at all that zira sided with scar during this fight even when her old friends were in danger zira still chose to be disloyal and side with a tyrant like scar with a roar she spun around on the younger lioness slamming her to the ground the older lionesses stood side by side while zira spun around on the ground until she got to her paws traitors zira screeched when the pteranodon screeched and soared above them her eyes mad and her claws sliding out followed by the terrible baying sound of dogs and the screeching of vultures when zira s anger with the baying and screeching growing louder and louder you ve ruined everything you ve betrayed scar scar was the one who betrayed us all sarabi snapped he was the one who ruined the pride lands he murdered mufasa and drove simba into exile zira scoffed and curled her lip i knew that he killed mufasa scar told me so on the day that he did it she sneered mufasa was weak compared to scar and simba was too much of a coward to actually stay scar was the one who united the lions and hyenas like no king has ever done before how dare you try to dismantle his legacy sarafina waited for her to rush her paws planted firmly on the rock if you mean by forcing the lionesses to go hungry while the hyenas steal our food then yes he did unite them he forced them together when a thing like that should never be done and he blamed my mate s death on my son my innocent son sarabi added ferociously how dare you justify everything scar has done with a ferocious snarl zira lunged at the older lioness sarabi reared up and caught her the two lionesses now biting and clawing zira swatted towards sarabi s eyes in an attempt to blind her but sarafina was already on the scene she crunched down on zira s tail making zira roar in pain before sarafina launched herself on top of her back raking at her flanks with her front claws as zira staggered back ready for more blood a mew made all three lionesses stop fighting nuka who was only a few months old looked up at them with scared amber eyes he looked almost like a younger scar except with a more innocent look sarabi s heart gave out to her nephew who had to put up with lions like scar and zira as parents come nuka we re leaving zira snapped at her son we re obviously not wanted here anymore but mama i don t wanna go nuka pleaded his eyes wide as zira towered over him they were nice to me and but zira scratched his ear making nuka yelp they re trying to overthrow scar but you would like to see your father fall wouldn t you she snarled and nuka began to sniffle now quit your crying and let s go as sarabi watched this she felt a motherly fury wash over her poor nuka didn t deserve all this he was just a cub it was zira and scar who had deprived her of raising her own cub and now it seemed like their cub was doomed to a life of misery with them so she stalked forward and gently rested a paw on her nephew s shoulder he s not going with you she retorted nuka s staying with us where you can t harm him anymore you have no right roared zira and she was frothing at the mouth you can t take my cub from me no nuka mewled i wanna stay with them don t make me leave zira looked absolutely furious and was ready to pounce on them to kill them but her paws already ached from fighting against more experiences to lionesses and she had no time for arguing plus she reckoned nuka would not survive a few months with the pride lands lions anyway not that she cared about him surviving she could have other cubs with scar or another lion healthier cubs that she would be more proud of fine keep that little termite you old hags she finally snarled he s no son of mine anyways and if scar burns then may all of you burn with him with one more spiteful glare at nuka and the others she limped away to the outlands nuka huddled closer to sarabi and sarafina sniffling and the lionesses gave each other a firm nod they would do their best to raise the young sickly cub as part of the pride so sarafina picked up nuka to carry him away from the battle while sarabi charged back to help her son fight simba sliced his claws against a hyena s face before leaping away panting heavily before him the battle had started to turn in favor of his side the hyenas may have had the numbers but the spirit of the lionesses and the jungle animals were what kept them from falling to the hyenas jaws as simba saw the hyenas start retreating he joined the lionesses in chasing them away from pride rock past the flames and fleeing across the pride lands but simba had no time to celebrate now running back towards pride rock he had to find scar fast and finish him off for good the smoke from the fire was settling in fast over pride rock making visibility hard if he couldn t find scar then the traitorous lion would get away with all his schemes and sins then when the lightning flashed against the face of the rock he finally spotted scar the older lion was trying to slink away towards the incline that led to the top of pride rock hoping to flee with a furious roar simba sprung forth scar noticed him and took off running climbing higher and higher up pride rock this almost took simba back to his cubhood days when mufasa had taken simba up to the top of pride rock to show him the kingdom now there was another event that was going to take place which anyone with keen eyes could observe from far away finally after minutes of running and leaping and climbing simba had caught up with scar the older lion was at the edge of the top of pride rock where he and mufasa used to watch the sun rise simba leaped through the flames and landed on the other side where no one would interfere murderer simba growled stalking closer and closer to scar it s over scar simba please let me explain scar pleaded have mercy on me simba ignored the pleading mercy after what you did you don t deserve to live scar backed up a little bit more but simba i am family he chuckled nervously i it s the hyenas who are the real enemy it s those revolting scavengers fault it was their idea i was planning on killing them all anyway unknowingly to them shenzi and her main minions banzai ed kamari and azizi followed simba and scar up pride rock to defend their ruler from simba but when they heard scar blaming them for all his problems and heard him call them revolting scavengers they backed away snarling in anger scar had promised to not show bigotry towards any hyenas during his reign as king but he was just as bad as plenty of lions that double crosser he s a little rat banzai snapped i can t believe we trusted him i kept saying we shouldn t have trusted him didn t i kamari snarled while azizi and ed snarled and bared their teeth as well he s gonna pay for going back on our deal oh we re gonna make him pay growled shenzi follow me boys let s let him deal with simba alone so they left the fighting to the two lions they would be back to pick up whatever scraps were left of either lion whichever one lost it was no skin off their nose if they tore that lion apart in the meantime simba was backing scar up against the edge of pride rock several images flashed in his mind him and nala going to the elephant graveyard him and scar going to the gorge the stampede those were not by accident scar had deliberately set those scenarios up to kill him and mufasa and even put nala in danger why should i believe you he asked furiously meeting scar s frightened eyes with his glare all the respect he had for his uncle was completely gone everything you ever told me was a lie you tried setting me and nala up to be killed you made me believe that i was the one who killed my father when it was you you ve lied to me to the pride and even to the hyenas you ve destroyed everything my father tried to uphold a king better than a son of hell that you are he s a dead king scar snapped back some of his old defiant fire returning he was just an arrogant pompous and overrated fool he was admired by all of his loyal subjects while i rotted in his shadow but i showed him i could have anything he had that i couldn t have loyal subjects a devoted queen with a roar simba ran over and knocked scar to the ground there was true terror in his uncle s green eyes as if he was mufasa coming back to life to judge him you think that because you killed my father you re better than him simba snarled his claws itching to swipe at scar all the time since you revealed your crimes i ve wondered what kind of lion would do such a thing there s nothing inside you scar nothing at all you re pathetic you re sad you re weak and above all you re nothing but a coward what are you going to do pleaded scar as his nephew towered over him you wouldn t kill your own uncle simba stared coldly down at scar his uncle really had to play that card even after he had murdered mufasa to get what he wanted he really did feel like tearing the older lion s throat out to see his life bleed out on the rock he even wanted to walk over to scar and push him over the edge of pride rock to see him die from the fall just as he had done to mufasa years ago all in all he just wanted scar gone but something held him back mercy simba knew that downright killing scar would not bring his father back nor would it grant him any peace he would be no better than his uncle if he decided to kill him especially if he were to push him just as his uncle had done to mufasa just seeing scar pay for his crimes once and for all would bring him peace no scar he finally declared stepping away from scar i m not like you as much as i hate you i can t do it i won t kill you so i ll let you live oh simba thank you scar exclaimed sounding relieved as he stood up you are truly noble i ll make it up to you i promise now how can i prove myself to you tell me anything tell me what you want me to do simba paused recalling when scar had told him to run away from the pride lands to never return then with no hesitation he growled the same words that scar told him years ago run run away scar and never return scar stood there shocked and unblinking for a moment the two lions stood face to face neither moving the embers from the raging fire twirled around them like burning bits of leaves and the battle between the lionesses and the hyenas fell deaf to their ears yes of course scar finally said slinking around simba but then out of simba s angry eyesight he noticed a pile of burning ashes and started walking slowly toward them as you wish your majesty blinded however simba yelled out in pain and recoiled trying to clear his eyes as nala watched simba her eyes widened in shock simba she cried out look out simba regained his bearings as he saw scar lunge towards him teeth bared and claws unsheathed fortunately nala pushed him away and began to grapple with him despite being smaller and older than nala scar managed to gain the advantage and pinned her down preparing to bite her neck until simba pushed him off get away from my future wife he declared which made nala s heart flutter as she smiled lovingly to him with simba returning the smile unfortunately scar chose that moment to knock him down as he attempted to choke his nephew whilst he smiled maliciously nala instantly got back up and swiped her claws at scar s face glaring at the tyrant don t you dare hurt my future husband she roared out shaking his head scar roared at the two lions with simba and nala roaring back as they began biting and clawing at each other to decide the fate of the pride lands scar pawed them off and they began to circle around each other waiting for their opponent to make the next move you can t win scar simba and nala both yelled this is my kingdom scar screamed defiantly at them my destiny scar lunged back with a roar while simba and nala did the same as the three lions continued to fight two on one using teamwork simba and nala were able to lay down some hits on scar as he attempted to do the same to no avail growling scar threw some dust up to blind them and knocked them on the ground before he leapt towards them intent on finishing them off for good scar ended up falling a long way with a roar tumbling down the side of pride rock until he landed with a thud heavy thud simba ran over to the edge to see what had happened to his uncle there at the bottom of the rock near his old den was scar gravely injured but still alive the dethroned lion was staggering as he struggled to get up limping all the way just as the hyenas came to greet him he noticed how they were approaching him as if he were prey instead of a friend ah my friends so glad to see you he greeted them with a grin limping to them he was half blinded now the scratch from simba having damaged most of his eye it will take some time but together we can rebuild our army and retake pride rock but the hyenas didn t smile or even return the greetings shenzi scoffed friends oh friends i thought he said we were the enemy yeah that s what i heard kamari replied and scar s smile instantly turned to horror we heard you call us revolting scavengers yeah and that you wanted to kill us growled azizi next to him the usually goofy ed bared his teeth angrily at their former employer no scar lied trying to keep his army under control he needed to lie to them some more to regain their support so that they would help him let me explain i was trying to fool him to get his guard down we can rule together but shenzi stood in his way blocking off his chance of escape scar you ain t nothin but a filthy liar and a hypocrite she snarled you said you would treat us right yet you called us scavengers to save your greasy little hide that s why you fought simba alone at least lions and hyenas hate each other naturally yet you used us not being in the pride lands to make us support you in fact she added a sneer in her tone you ain t no lion you re nothin but a snake scar was backing away from her now no longer able to escape his lies had all been used up he had no more tricks up his sleeve and the hyenas had seen his true colors at last there s only one true thing you ever said scar shenzi went on a sadistic grin on her muzzle as she stood before scar with the fire around them a hyena s belly is never full yeah that s what i heard banzai repeated what kamari had said he kamari azizi and shenzi turned their heads to ed one more time asking ed ed usually the stupid one actually had a cruel smirk on his face then he let out a low and frightening giggle and the hyenas started to creep toward the lion they once called ally it was ed s call that ultimately rallied the hyenas into a feeding frenzy scar kept backing away trying more to justify himself but it was too late all of the hyenas launched their attack at once biting and ripping at scar with sheer brutality scar swatted his claws at several hyenas briefly earning him reprieve as he killed one but he ended up getting pushed back then as if one creature the hyenas rushed in knocking scar down and tearing at his flesh with their fangs in a few moments scar was dead done in by his own army and the hyenas were now filling their bellies simba had watched them all with wide eyes he knew hyenas weren t the smartest animals from africa but in north america and they certainly knew how to hold a grudge once they had started to kill scar simba turned away to go back to the lionesses his late uncle s screams rattling his ears in the end scar ended up paying for his wrongdoing with a lesson he would never forget watching scar s death was strom a griffon vulture strom had no c,"['dog', 'trust', 'drop', 'girlie', 'screech',

give give give some more give a lot but never settling the score give to you out of gratitude and piety give to you since you re on this ride with me me and you we go way way back and if it weren t for you i d be off track for you i cry smile fight help laugh and all you did was laugh at my jokes and smile back i devote myself to you in every way although my self serving nature is my dismay i grow stronger and stronger every day to make a difference before i decay i can t express what acknowledgement means to me but i hope to give it a shot before my feet deplete if there s anything i can do you know just reach to me and i ll be there i am how i now seem to be to be free i need to give back to the people give back since my favorite part of life is all of you ok i m on and on and on so much i m gone with it the point is serving is my calling nothing wrong with it verse lots of love inside my heart guaranteed that i m sharing i know you want to have to work for my compliments i know you want to repent but to what extent do you need to choke on your laments before you realize that withholding love is a cycle that never ends viciously turning us against who we ought to just treat as friends instead of enemies mentally i m not that lucid but if i organize these rhymes then i might just work through this puzzle called life which has millions of simple answers yet every single one of them really makes my hands hurt from fighting the truth i can t settle on pessimistic views because of you no matter how realistic cynicism seems to be i m just me trying to get better to give you love that s guaranteed and i might slack off or self serve or be thin but when i give i give my all and i don t give in verse i gave you evidence these labels we use always are wack nobody is just one thing but people like to try that you think i m just a rapper you think i m just a man there are countless labels that describe who i am and who you are and who we all aspire to be because even though you might live life trying be who s on tv if you are true to yourself your aspirations will be deep and countless many different ambitions ounces of water inside your head directing you to get ahead and consume an abundance of different experiences before you re dead hasn t that already been said sorry i m just a bit obsessed i want to give people my point of view since i can t fully live it but i see so much love and beauty that i want people to live it because life is hard and it s so tragic i ve seen many people quit by simply comfort zoning out stuck in a box perpetually sit give out free samples of you let people know what s going on inside your booth i see a world where we re close like we ve been super glued by love acceptance and appreciation we re going to do what we do i go on and on and on and i might not stop but it s just a rap album so i guess it s fine to rock i might roll too i don t mind driving on roads with toll booths if i know you know that i have something to show you it s this album if you made it this far here is the outcome i ve bared my heart and soul and my mind although i may be without one because i m so dumb or should i say idiotic i could be volunteering really helping instead of breeding milotics there s no profit from time wasting although i often do i might just put on my shoes and find something else to do i m a weak person i give a lot but not enough to calm me i push myself to give more and i do not do so wrongly i ve given everything i ve got but most of y all still ain t feelin me matter of fact one of the only things i have yet to give is my virginity you might also like verse here s a mini fourth last verse four isn t the magic number but this song could use a curse i just rambled about nothing hypocritically asked you to work and i m a jerk a liar a villainous user of fire to burn bridges independent for the most part and i love people so much but introverted is my heart and for the most part i d call life a beautiful work of art a constantly crumbling collection of recycling resourceful confusing parts and my album art is just me a little newborn baby who s exploring the world around him out the egg it looks crazy and if you think this album s a poorly formed work of fiction it s an intentional inspection of duality disguised as contradiction with no precision and with it consider this song

Fe,spotify:track:4jTOnif50SaIYnDW6GPf0O,victory chap lyricsthe observer was martin ricardo to him life was not a matter of passive renunciation but of a particularly active warfare he was not mistrustful of it he was not disgusted with it still less was he inclined to be suspicious of its disenchantments but he was vividly aware that it held many possibilities of failure though very far from being a pessimist he was not a man of foolish illusions he did not like failure not only because of its unpleasant and dangerous consequences but also because of its damaging effect upon his own appreciation of martin ricardo and this was a special job of his own contriving and of considerable novelty it was not so to speak in his usual line of business except perhaps from a moral standpoint about which he was not likely to trouble his head for these reasons martin ricardo was unable to sleep mr jones after repeated shivering fits and after drinking much hot tea had apparently fallen into deep slumber he had very peremptorily discouraged attempts at conversation on the part of his faithful follower ricardo listened to his regular breathing it was all very well for the governor he looked upon it as a sort of sport a gentleman naturally would but this ticklish and important job had to be pulled off at all costs both for honour and for safety ricardo rose quietly and made his way on the veranda he could not lie still he wanted to go out for air and he had a feeling that by the force of his eagerness even the darkness and the silence could be made to yield something to his eyes and ears he noted the stars and stepped back again into the dense darkness he resisted the growing impulse to go out and steal towards the other bungalow it would have been madness to start prowling in the dark on unknown ground and for what end unless to relieve the oppression immobility lay on his limbs like a leaden garment and yet he was unwilling to give up he persisted in his objectless vigil the man of the island was keeping quiet it was at that moment that ricardo s eyes caught the vanishing red trail of light made by the cigar a startling revelation of the man s wakefulness he could not suppress a low hallo and began to sidle along towards the door with his shoulders rubbing the wall for all he knew the man might have been out in front by this time observing the veranda as a matter of fact after flinging away the cheroot heyst had gone indoors with the feeling of a man who gives up an unprofitable occupation but ricardo fancied he could hear faint footfalls on the open ground and dodged quickly into the room there he drew breath and meditated for a while his next step was to feel for the matches on the tall desk and to light the candle he had to communicate to his governor views and reflections of such importance that it was absolutely necessary for him to watch their effect on the very countenance of the hearer at first he had thought that these matters could have waited till daylight but heyst s wakefulness disclosed in that startling way made him feel suddenly certain that there could be no sleep for him that night he said as much to his governor when the little dagger like flame had done its best to dispel the darkness mr jones was to be seen reposing on a camp bedstead in a distant part of the room a railway rug concealed his spare form up to his very head which rested on the other railway rug rolled up for a pillow ricardo plumped himself down cross legged on the floor very close to the low bedstead so that mr jones who perhaps had not been so very profoundly asleep on opening his eyes found them conveniently levelled at the face of his secretary eh what is it you say no sleep for you tonight but why can t you let me sleep confound your fussiness because that there fellow can t sleep that s why dash me if he hasn t been doing a think just now what business has he to think in the middle of the night how do you know he was out sir up in the middle of the night my own eyes saw it but how do you know that he was up to think inquired mr jones it might have been anything toothache for instance and you may have dreamed it for all i know didn t you try to sleep no sir i didn t even try to go to sleep ricardo informed his patron of his vigil on the veranda and of the revelation which put an end to it he concluded that a man up with a cigar in the middle of the night must be doing a think mr jones raised himself on his elbow this sign of interest comforted his faithful henchman seems to me it s time we did a little think ourselves added ricardo with more assurance long as they had been together the moods of his governor were still a source of anxiety to his simple soul you are always making a fuss remarked mr jones in a tolerant tone ay but not for nothing am i you can t say that sir mine may not be a gentleman s way of looking round a thing but it isn t a fool s way either you ve admitted that much yourself at odd times ricardo was growing warmly argumentative mr jones interrupted him without heat you haven t roused me to talk about yourself i presume no sir ricardo remained silent for a minute with the tip of his tongue caught between his teeth i don t think i could tell you anything about myself that you don t know he continued there was a sort of amused satisfaction in his tone which changed completely as he went on it s that man over there that s got to be talked over i don t like him he failed to observe the flicker of a ghastly smile on his governor s lips don t you murmured mr jones whose face as he reclined on his elbow was on a level with the top of his follower s head no sir said ricardo emphatically the candle from the other side of the room threw his monstrous black shadow on the wall he i don t know how to say it he isn t hearty like mr jones agreed languidly in his own manner he seems to be a very self possessed man ay that s it self ricardo choked with indignation i would soon let out some of his self possession through a hole between his ribs if this weren t a special job mr jones had been making his own reflections for he asked do you think he is suspicious i don t see very well what he can be suspicious of pondered ricardo yet there he was doing a think and what could be the object of it what made him get out of his bed in the middle of the night tain t fleas surely bad conscience perhaps suggested mr jones jocularly his faithful secretary suffered from irritation and did not see the joke in a fretful tone he declared that there was no such thing as conscience there was such a thing as funk but there was nothing to make that fellow funky in any special way he admitted however that the man might have been uneasy at the arrival of strangers because of all that plunder of his put away somewhere ricardo glanced here and there as if he were afraid of being overheard by the heavy shadows cast by the dim light all over the room his patron very quiet spoke in a calm whisper and perhaps that hotel keeper has been lying to you about him he may be a very poor devil indeed ricardo shook his head slightly the schombergian theory of heyst had become in him a profound conviction which he had absorbed as naturally as a sponge takes up water his patron s doubts were a wanton denying of what was self evident but ricardo s voice remained as before a soft purring with a snarling undertone i am sup prised at you sir it s the very way them tame ones the common yporcrits of the world get on when it comes to plunder drifting under one s very nose there s not one of them that would keep his hands off and i don t blame them it s the way they do it that sets my back up just look at the story of how he got rid of that pal of his send a man home to croak of a cold on the chest that s one of your tame tricks and d you mean to say sir that a man that s up to it wouldn t bag whatever he could lay his hands in his yporcritical way what was all that coal business tame citizen dodge yporcrisy nothing else no no sir the thing is to extract it from him as neatly as possible that s the job and it isn t so simple as it looks i reckon you have looked at it all round sir before you took up the notion of this trip no mr jones was hardly audible staring far away from his couch i didn t think about it much i was bored ay that you were bad i was feeling pretty desperate that afternoon when that bearded softy of a landlord got talking to me about this fellow here quite accidentally it was well sir here we are after a mighty narrow squeak i feel all limp yet but never mind his swag will pay for the lot he s all alone here remarked mr jones in a hollow murmur ye es in a way yes alone enough yes you may say he is there s that chinaman though ay there s the chink assented ricardo rather absentmindedly he was debating in his mind the advisability of making a clean breast of his knowledge of the girl s existence finally he concluded he wouldn t the enterprise was difficult enough without complicating it with an upset to the sensibilities of the gentleman with whom he had the honour of being associated let the discovery come of itself he thought and then he could swear that he had known nothing of that offensive presence he did not need to lie he had only to hold his tongue yes he muttered reflectively there s that chink certainly at bottom he felt a certain ambiguous respect for his governor s exaggerated dislike of women as if that horror of feminine presence were a sort of depraved morality but still morality since he counted it as an advantage it prevented many undesirable complications he did not pretend to understand it he did not even try to investigate this idiosyncrasy of his chief all he knew was that he himself was differently inclined and that it did not make him any happier or safer he did not know how he would have acted if he had been knocking about the world on his own luckily he was a subordinate not a wage slave but a follower which was a restraint yes the other sort of disposition simplified matters in general it wasn t to be gainsaid but it was clear that it could also complicate them as in this most important and in ricardo s view already sufficiently delicate case and the worst of it was that one could not tell exactly in what precise manner it would act it was unnatural he thought somewhat peevishly how was one to reckon up the unnatural there were no rules for that the faithful henchman of plain mr jones foreseeing many difficulties of a material order decided to keep the girl out of the governor s knowledge out of his sight too for as long a time as it could be managed that alas seemed to be at most a matter of a few hours whereas ricardo feared that to get the affair properly going would take some days once well started he was not afraid of his gentleman failing him as is often the case with lawless natures ricardo s faith in any given individual was of a simple unquestioning character for man must have some support in life cross legged his head drooping a little and perfectly still he might have been meditating in a bonze like attitude upon the sacred syllable om it was a striking illustration of the untruth of appearances for his contempt for the world was of a severely practical kind there was nothing oriental about ricardo but the amazing quietness of his pose mr jones was also very quiet he had let his head sink on the rolled up rug and lay stretched out on his side with his back to the light in that position the shadows gathered in the cavities of his eyes made them look perfectly empty when he spoke his ghostly voice had only to travel a few inches straight into ricardo s left ear why don t you say something now that you ve got me awake i wonder if you were sleeping as sound as you are trying to make out sir said the unmoved ricardo i wonder repeated mr jones at any rate i was resting quietly come sir ricardo s whisper was alarmed you don t mean to say you re going to be bored no quite right the secretary was very much relieved there s no occasion to be i can tell you sir he whispered earnestly anything but that if i didn t say anything for a bit it ain t because there isn t plenty to talk about ay more than enough what s the matter with you breathed out his patron are you going to turn pessimist me turn no sir i ain t of those that turn you may call me hard names if you like but you know very well that i ain t a croaker ricardo changed his tone if i said nothing for a while it was because i was meditating over the chink sir you were waste of time my martin a chinaman is unfathomable ricardo admitted that this might be so anyhow a chink was neither here nor there as a general thing unfathomable as he might be but a swedish baron wasn t couldn t be the woods were full of such barons i don t know that he is so tame was mr jones s remark in a sepulchral undertone how do you mean sir he ain t a rabbit of course you couldn t hypnotize him as i saw you do to more than one dago and other kinds of tame citizens when it came to the point of holding them down to a game don t you reckon on that murmured plain mr jones seriously no sir i don t though you have a wonderful power of the eye it s a fact i have a wonderful patience remarked mr jones dryly a dim smile flitted over the lips of the faithful ricardo who never raised his head i don t want to try you too much sir but this is like no other job we ever turned our minds to perhaps not at any rate let us think so a weariness with the monotony of life was reflected in the tone of this qualified assent it jarred on the nerves of the sanguine ricardo let us think of the way to go to work he retorted a little impatiently he s a deep one just look at the way he treated that chum of his did you ever hear of anything so low and the artfulness of the beast the dirty tame artfulness don t you start moralizing martin said mr jones warningly as far as i can make out the story that german hotel keeper told you it seems to show a certain amount of character and independence from common feelings which is not usual it s very remarkable if true ay ay very remarkable it s mighty low down all the same muttered ricardo obstinately i must say i am glad to think he will be paid off for it in a way that ll surprise him the tip of his tongue appeared lively for an instant as if trying for the taste of that ferocious retribution on his compressed lips for ricardo was sincere in his indignation before the elementary principle of loyalty to a chum violated in cold blood slowly in a patient duplicity of years there are standards in villainy as in virtue and the act as he pictured it to himself acquired an additional horror from the slow pace of that treachery so atrocious and so tame but he understood too the educated judgement of his governor a gentleman looking on all this with the privileged detachment of a cultivated mind of an elevated personality ay he s deep he s artful he mumbled between his sharp teeth confound you mr jones s calm whisper crept into his ear come to the point obedient the secretary shook off his thoughtfulness there was a similarity of mind between these two one the outcast of his vices the other inspired by a spirit of scornful defiance the aggressiveness of a beast of prey looking upon all the tame creatures of the earth as its natural victim both were astute enough however and both were aware that they had plunged into this adventure without a sufficient scrutiny of detail the figure of a lonely man far from all assistance had loomed up largely fascinating and defenceless in the middle of the sea filling the whole field of their vision there had not seemed to be any need for thinking as schomberg had been saying three to one but it did not look so simple now in the face of that solitude which was like an armour for this man the feeling voiced by the henchman in his own way we don t seem much forwarder now we are here was acknowledged by the silence of the patron it was easy enough to rip a fellow up or drill a hole in him whether he was alone or not ricardo reflected in low confidential tones but he isn t alone mr jones said faintly in his attitude of a man composed for sleep don t forget that chinaman ricardo started slightly oh ay the chink ricardo had been on the point of confessing about the girl but no he wanted his governor to be unperturbed and steady vague thoughts which he hardly dared to look in the face were stirring his brain in connection with that girl she couldn t be much account he thought she could be frightened and there were also other possibilities the chink however could be considered openly what i was thinking about it sir he went on earnestly is this here we ve got a man he s nothing if he won t be good he can be made quiet that s easy but then there s his plunder he doesn t carry it in his pocket i hope not breathed mr jones same here it s too big we know but if he were alone he would not feel worried about it overmuch i mean the safety of the pieces he would just put the lot into any box or drawer that was handy would he yes sir he would keep it under his eye as it were why not it is natural a fellow doesn t put his swag underground unless there s a very good reason for it a very good reason eh yes sir what do you think a fellow is a mole from his experience ricardo declared that man was not a burrowing beast even the misers very seldom buried their hoard unless for exceptional reasons in the given situation of a man alone on an island the company of a chink was a very good reason drawers would not be safe nor boxes either from a prying slant eyed chink no sir unless a safe a proper office safe but the safe was there in the room is there a safe in this room i didn t notice it whispered mr jones that was because the thing was painted white like the walls of the room and besides it was tucked away in the shadows of a corner mr jones had been too tired to observe anything on his first coming ashore but ricardo had very soon spotted the characteristic form he only wished he could believe that the plunder of treachery duplicity and all the moral abominations of heyst had been there but no the blamed thing was open it might have been there at one time or another he commented gloomily but it isn t there now the man did not elect to live in this house remarked mr jones and by the by what could he have meant by speaking of circumstances which prevented him lodging us in the other bungalow you remember what he said martin sounded cryptic martin who remembered and understood the phrase as directly motived by the existence of the girl waited a little before saying some of his artfulness sir and not the worst of it either that manner of his to us this asking no questions is some more of his artfulness a man s bound to be curious and he is yet he goes on as if he didn t care he does care or else what was he doing up with a cigar in the middle of the night doing a think i don t like it he may be outside observing the light here and saying the very same thing to himself of our own wakefulness gravely suggested ricardo s governor he may be sir but this is too important to be talked over in the dark and the light is all right it can be accounted for there s a light in this bungalow in the middle of the night because why because you are not well not well sir that s what s the matter and you will have to act up to it the consideration had suddenly occurred to the faithful henchman in the light of a felicitous expedient to keep his governor and the girl apart as long as possible mr jones received the suggestion without the slightest stir even in the deep sockets of his eyes where a steady faint gleam was the only thing telling of life and attention in his attenuated body but ricardo as soon as he had enunciated his happy thought perceived in it other possibilities more to the point and of greater practical advantage with your looks sir it will be easy enough he went on evenly as if no silence had intervened always respectful but frank with perfect simplicity of purpose all you ve got to do is just to lie down quietly i noticed him looking sort of surprised at you on the wharf sir at these words a naive tribute to the aspect of his physique even more suggestive of the grave than of the sick bed a fold appeared on that side of the governor s face which was exposed to the dim light a deep shadowy semicircular fold from the side of the nose to bottom of the chin a silent smile by a side glance ricardo had noted this play of features he smiled too appreciative encouraged and you as hard as nails all the time he went on hang me if anybody would believe you aren t sick if i were to swear myself black in the face give us a day or two to look into matters and size up that yporcrit ricardo s eyes remained fixed on his crossed shins the chief in his lifeless accents approved perhaps it would be a good idea the chink he s nothing he can be made quiet any time one of ricardo s hands reposing palm upwards on his folded legs made a swift thrusting gesture repeated by the enormous darting shadow of an arm very low on the wall it broke the spell of perfect stillness in the room the secretary eyed moodily the wall from which the shadow had gone anybody could be made quiet he pointed out it was not anything that the chink could do no it was the effect that his company must have produced on the conduct of the doomed man a man what was a man a swedish baron could be ripped up or else holed by a shot as easily as any other creature but that was exactly what was to be avoided till one knew where he had hidden his plunder i shouldn t think it would be some sort of hole in his bungalow argued ricardo with real anxiety no a house can be burnt set on fire accidentally or on purpose while a man s asleep under the house or in some crack cranny or crevice something told him it wasn t that the anguish of mental effort contracted ricardo s brow the skin of his head seemed to move in this travail of vain and tormenting suppositions what did you think a fellow is sir a baby he said in answer to mr jones s objections i am trying to find out what i would do myself he wouldn t be likely to be cleverer than i am and what do you know about yourself mr jones seemed to watch his follower s perplexities with amusement concealed in a death like composure ricardo disregarded the question the material vision of the spoil absorbed all his faculties a great vision he seemed to see it a few small canvas bags tied up with thin cord their distended rotundity showing the inside pressure of the disk like forms of coins gold solid heavy eminently portable perhaps steel cash boxes with a chased design on the covers or perhaps a black and brass box with a handle on the top and full of goodness knows what bank notes why not the fellow had been going home so it was surely something worth going home with and he may have put it anywhere outside anywhere cried ricardo in a deadened voice in the forest that was it a temporary darkness replaced the dim light of the room the darkness of the forest at night and in it the gleam of a lantern by which a figure is digging at the foot of a tree trunk as likely as not another figure holding that lantern ha feminine the girl the prudent ricardo stifled a picturesque and profane exclamation partly joy partly dismay had the girl been trusted or mistrusted by that man whatever it was it was bound to be wholly with women there could be no half measures he could not imagine a fellow half trusting a woman in that intimate relation to himself and in those particular circumstances of conquest and loneliness where no confidences could appear dangerous since apparently there could be no one she could give him away to moreover in nine cases out of ten the woman would be trusted but trusted or mistrusted was her presence a favourable or unfavourable condition of the problem that was the question the temptation to consult his chief to talk over the weighty fact and get his opinion on it was great indeed ricardo resisted it but the agony of his solitary mental conflict was extremely sharp a woman in a problem is an incalculable quantity even if you have something to go upon in forming your guess how much more so when you haven t even once caught sight of her swift as were his mental processes he felt that a longer silence was inadvisable he hastened to speak and do you see us sir you and i with a couple of spades having to tackle this whole confounded island he allowed himself a slight movement of the arm the shadow enlarged it into a sweeping gesture this seems rather discouraging martin murmured the unmoved governor we mustn t be discouraged that s all retorted his henchman and after what we had to go through in that boat too why it would be he couldn t find the qualifying words very calm faithful and yet astute he expressed his new born hopes darkly something s sure to turn up to give us a hint only this job can t be rushed you may depend on me to pick up the least little bit of a hint but you sir you ve got to play him very gently for the rest you can trust me yes but i ask myself what you are trusting to our luck said the faithful ricardo don t say a word against that it might spoil the run of it you are a superstitious beggar no i won t say anything against it that s right sir don t you even think lightly of it luck s not to be played with yes luck s a delicate thing assented mr jones in a dreamy whisper a short silence ensued which ricardo ended in a discreet and tentative voice talking of luck i suppose he could be made to take a hand with you sir two handed picket or ekkarty you being seedy and keeping indoors just to pass the time for all we know he may be one of them hot ones once they start is it likely came coldly from the principal considering what we know of his history say with his partner true sir he s a cold blooded beast a cold blooded inhuman and i ll tell you another thing that isn t likely he would not be likely to let himself be stripped bare we haven t to do with a young fool that can be led on by chaff or flattery and in the end simply overawed this is a calculating man ricardo recognized that clearly what he had in his mind was something on a small scale just to keep the enemy busy while he ricardo had time to nose around a bit you could even lose a little money to him sir he suggested i could ricardo was thoughtful for a moment he strikes me too as the sort of man to start prancing when one didn t expect it what do you think sir is he a man that would prance that is if something startled him more likely to prance than to run what the answer came at once because mr jones understood the peculiar idiom of his faithful follower oh without doubt without doubt it does me good to hear that you think so he s a prancing beast and so we mustn t startle him not till i have located the stuff afterwards ricardo paused sinister in the stillness of his pose suddenly he got up with a swift movement and gazed down at his chief in moody abstraction mr jones did not stir there s one thing that s worrying me began ricardo in a subdued voice only one was the faint comment from the motionless body on the bedstead i mean more than all the others put together that s grave news ay grave enough it s this how do you feel in yourself sir are you likely to get bored i know them fits come on you suddenly but surely you can tell martin you are an ass the moody face of the secretary brightened up really sir well i am quite content to be on these terms i mean as long as you don t get bored it wouldn t do sir for coolness ricardo had thrown open his shirt and rolled up his sleeves he moved stealthily across the room bare footed towards the candle the shadow of his head and shoulders growing bigger behind him on the opposite wall to which the face of plain mr jones was turned with a feline movement ricardo glanced over his shoulder at the thin back of the spectre reposing on the bed and then blew out the candle in fact i am rather amused martin mr jones said in the dark he heard the sound of a slapped thigh and the jubilant exclamation of his henchman good that s the way to talk sir embed,"['uneasy', 'asleep', 'trust', 'slave', 'keeper', 'discreet', 'cheroot', 'hint', 'note', 'evenly', 'luck', 'moody', 'reckon', 'unfathomable', 'unperturbed', 'detail',

discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience both were sensitive to artistic impressions musical in preference to plastic or pictorial both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious national social and ethical doctrines both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism were their views on some points divergent stephen dissented openly from bloom s view on the importance of dietary and civic self help while bloom dissented tacitly from stephen s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature bloom assented covertly to stephen s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the irish nation to christianity from druidism by patrick son of calpornus son of potitus son of odyssus sent by pope celestine i in the year in the reign of leary to the year or thereabouts in the reign of cormac macart a d suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at sletty and interred at rossnaree the collapse which bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud perceived by both from two different points of observation sandycove and dublin at first no bigger than a woman s hand was there one point on which their views were equal and negative the influence of gaslight or electric

with julius mastiansky on both occasions in the parlour of his bloom s house in lombard street west what reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates did bloom make before their arrival at their destination he reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations as in what ways from inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received existence with existence he was with any as any with any from existence to nonexistence

respectively and inadvertently keyless couple to enter or not to enter to knock or not to knock bloom s decision a stratagem resting his feet on the dwarf wall he climbed over the area railings compressed his hat on his head grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of

by regulating he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle what discrete succession of images did stephen meanwhile perceive reclined against the area railings he perceived

on its hinges in the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat with his candle did stephen obey his sign yes entering softly he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man s back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen

erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction what did bloom see on the range on the right smaller hob a blue enamelled saucepan on the left larger hob a black iron kettle what did bloom do at the range he removed the saucepan to the left hob rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow

at an initial plant cost of per linear yard by way of the dargle rathdown glen of the downs and callowhill to the acre reservoir at stillorgan a distance of statute miles and thence through a system of relieving tanks by a gradient of feet to the city boundary at eustace bridge upper leeson street though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer mr spencer harty c e on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the importable water of the grand and royal canals as in particularly as the south dublin

last bath having taken place in the month of october of the preceding year disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal distrusting aquacities of thought and language what impeded bloom from giving stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape stomach and thenar or sole of foot the incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius what additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress dietary concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon salt ling and butter the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest confidence in himself

boiling point a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of thermal units needed to raise i pound of water from to fahrenheit what announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature a double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously for what personal purpose could bloom have applied the water so boiled to shave himself what advantages attended shaving by night a softer beard a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours quiet reflections upon the course of the day a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises premonitions and perturbations a clattered milkcan a postman s double knock a paper read reread while lathering relathering the same spot a shock a shoot with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered which was to be done why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noises because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand what quality did it his hand possess but with what counteracting influence the operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means preferring in their natural order heliotherapy psychophysicotherapeutics osteopathic

difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation his mood he had not risked he did not expect he had not been disappointed he

ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed what supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation crown derby presented to him by his only daughter millicent milly he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and in

accompanied his frequentative act concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of william shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life had he found their

age that of methusalah years while if stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the year a d bloom would have been obliged to have been alive years having been obliged to have been born in the year b c what events might nullify these calculations the cessation of existence of both or either the inauguration of a new era or calendar the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species inevitable but impredictable how many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance two the first in the lilacgarden of matthew dillon s house

on a rainy sunday in the january of in the company of stephen s father and stephen s granduncle stephen being then years older did bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father very gratefully with grateful appreciation with sincere appreciative gratitude in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret he declined did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them mrs riordan a widow of independent means had resided in the house of stephen s parents from september to december and had also resided during the years and in the city arms hotel owned by elizabeth o dowd of prussia street where during parts of the years and she had been a constant informant of bloom who resided also in the same hotel being at that time a clerk in the employment of joseph cuffe of smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent dublin cattle market on the north circular road had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her he had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings an infirm widow of independent if limited means in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the north circular road opposite mr gavin low s place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular

the city to the phoenix park and vice versa why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of

of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness the younger her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the immaculate conception her green and maroon brushes for charles stewart parnell and for michael davitt her tissue papers were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable the indoor exercises formerly intermittently practised subsequently abandoned prescribed in eugen sandow s physical strength and how to obtain it which designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility had any special agility been his in earlier youth though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a high school scholar he had excelled in his table and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles did either openly allude to their racial difference neither what reduced to their simplest reciprocal form were bloom s thoughts about stephen s thoughts about bloom and bloom s thoughts about stephen

albertine at daybreak my face still turned to the wall and before i had seen above the big inner curtains what tone the first streaks of light assumed i could already tell what sort of day it was the first sounds from the street had told me according to whether they came to my ears dulled and distorted by the moisture of the atmosphere or quivering like arrows in the resonant and empty area of a spacious crisply frozen pure morning as soon as i heard the rumble of the first tramcar i could tell whether it was sodden with rain or setting forth into the blue and perhaps these sounds had themselves been forestalled by some swifter and more pervasive emanation which stealing into my slumber diffused in it a melancholy that seemed to presage snow or gave utterance through the lips of a little person who occasionally reappeared there to so many hymns to the glory of the sun that having first of all begun to smile in my sleep having prepared my eyes behind their shut lids to be dazzled i awoke finally amid deafening strains of music it was moreover principally from my bedroom that i took in the life of the outer world during this period i know that bloch reported that when he called to see me in the evenings he could hear the sound of conversation as my mother was at combray and he never found anybody in my room he concluded that i was talking to myself when much later he learned that albertine had been staying with me at the time and realised that i had concealed her presence from all my friends he declared that he saw at last the reason why during that episode in my life i had always refused to go out of doors he was wrong his mistake was however quite pardonable for the truth even if it is inevitable is not always conceivable as a whole people who learn some accurate detail of another person s life at once deduce consequences which are not accurate and see in the newly discovered fact an explanation of things that have no connexion with it whatsoever when i reflect now that my mistress had come on our return from balbec to live in paris under the same roof as myself that she had abandoned the idea of going on a cruise that she was installed in a bedroom within twenty paces of my own at the end of the corridor in my father s tapestried study and that late every night before leaving me she used to slide her tongue between my lips like a portion of daily bread a nourishing food that had the almost sacred character of all flesh upon which the sufferings that we have endured on its account have come in time to confer a sort of spiritual grace what i at once call to mind in comparison is not the night that captain de borodino allowed me to spend in barracks a favour which cured what was after all only a passing distemper but the night on which my father sent mamma to sleep in the little bed by the side of my own so it is that life if it is once again to deliver us from an anguish that has seemed inevitable does so in conditions that are different so diametrically opposed at times that it is almost an open sacrilege to assert the identity of the grace bestowed upon us when albertine had heard from fran oise that in the darkness of my still curtained room i was not asleep she had no scruple about making a noise as she took her bath in her own dressing room then frequently instead of waiting until later in the day i would repair to a bathroom adjoining hers which had a certain charm of its own time was when a stage manager would spend hundreds of thousands of francs to begem with real emeralds the throne upon which a great actress would play the part of an empress the russian ballet has taught us that simple arrangements of light will create if trained upon the right spot jewels as gorgeous and more varied this decoration itself immaterial is not so graceful however as that which at eight o clock in the morning the sun substitutes for what we were accustomed to see when we did not arise before noon the windows of our respective bathrooms so that their occupants might not be visible from without were not of clear glass but clouded with an artificial and old fashioned kind of frost all of a sudden the sun would colour this drapery of glass gild it and discovering in myself an earlier young man whom habit had long concealed would intoxicate me with memories as though i were out in the open country gazing at a hedge of golden leaves in which even a bird was not lacking for i could hear albertine ceaselessly humming for melancholy is but folly and he who heeds it is a fool i loved her so well that i could spare a joyous smile for her bad taste in music this song had as it happened during the past summer delighted mme bontemps who presently heard people say that it was silly with the result that instead of asking albertine to sing it when she had a party she would substitute a song of farewell rises from troubled springs which in its turn became an old jingle of massenet s the child is always dinning into our ears a cloud passed blotting out the sun i saw extinguished and replaced by a grey monochrome the modest screening foliage of the glass the partition that divided our two dressing rooms albertine s identical with my own was a bathroom which mamma who had another at the other end of the flat had never used for fear of disturbing my rest was so slender that we could talk to each other as we washed in double privacy carrying on a conversation that was interrupted only by the sound of the water in that intimacy which in hotels is so often permitted by the smallness and proximity of the rooms but which in private houses in paris is so rare on other mornings i would remain in bed drowsing for as long as i chose for orders had been given that no one was to enter my room until i had rung the bell an act which owing to the awkward position in which the electric bulb had been hung above my bed took such a time that often tired of feeling for it and glad to be left alone i would lie back for some moments and almost fall asleep again it was not that i was wholly indifferent to albertine s presence in the house her separation from her girl friends had the effect of sparing my heart any fresh anguish she kept it in a state of repose in a semi immobility which would help it to recover but after all this calm which my mistress was procuring for me was a release from suffering rather than a positive joy not that it did not permit me to taste many joys from which too keen a grief had debarred me but these joys so far from my owing them to albertine in whom for that matter i could no longer see any beauty and who was beginning to bore me with whom i was now clearly conscious that i was not in love i tasted on the contrary when albertine was not with me and so to begin the morning i did not send for her at once especially if it was a fine day for some moments knowing that he would make me happier than albertine i remained closeted with the little person inside me hymning the rising sun of whom i have already spoken of those elements which compose our personality it is not the most obvious that are most essential in myself when ill health has succeeded in uprooting them one after another there will still remain two or three endowed with a hardier constitution than the rest notably a certain philosopher who is happy only when he has discovered in two works of art in two sensations a common element but the last of all i have sometimes asked myself whether it would not be this little mannikin very similar to another whom the optician at combray used to set up in his shop window to forecast the weather and who doffing his hood when the sun shone would put it on again if it was going to rain this little mannikin i know his egoism i may be suffering from a choking fit which the mere threat of rain would calm he pays no heed and at the first drops so impatiently awaited losing his gaiety sullenly pulls down his hood conversely i dare say that in my last agony when all my other selves are dead if a ray of sunshine steals into the room while i am drawing my last breath the little fellow of the barometer will feel a great relief and will throw back his hood to sing ah fine weather at last i rang for fran oise i opened the figaro i scanned its columns and made sure that it did not contain an article or so called article which i had sent to the editor and which was no more than a slightly revised version of the page that had recently come to light written long ago in dr percepied s carriage as i gazed at the spires of martinville then i read mamma s letter she felt it to be odd in fact shocking that a girl should be staying in the house alone with me on the first day at the moment of leaving balbec when she saw how wretched i was and was distressed by the prospect of leaving me by myself my mother had perhaps been glad when she heard that albertine was travelling with us and saw that side by side with our own boxes those boxes among which i had passed a night in tears in the balbec hotel there had been hoisted into the twister albertine s boxes also narrow and black which had seemed to me to have the appearance of coffins and as to which i knew not whether they were bringing to my house life or death but i had never even asked myself the question being all overjoyed in the radiant morning after the fear of having to remain at balbec that i was taking albertine with me but to this proposal if at the start my mother had not been hostile speaking kindly to my friend like a mother whose son has been seriously wounded and who is grateful to the young mistress who is nursing him with loving care she had acquired hostility now that it had been too completely realised and the girl was prolonging her sojourn in our house and moreover in the absence of my parents i cannot however say that my mother ever made this hostility apparent as in the past when she had ceased to dare to reproach me with my nervous instability my laziness now she felt a hesitation which i perhaps did not altogether perceive at the moment or refused to perceive to run the risk by offering any criticism of the girl to whom i had told her that i intended to make an offer of marriage of bringing a shadow into my life making me in time to come less devoted to my wife of sowing perhaps for a season when she herself would no longer be there the seeds of remorse at having grieved her by marrying albertine mamma preferred to seem to be approving a choice which she felt herself powerless to make me reconsider but people who came in contact with her at this time have since told me that in addition to her grief at having lost her mother she had an air of constant preoccupation this mental strife this inward debate had the effect of overheating my mother s brow and she was always opening the windows to let in the fresh air but she did not succeed in coming to any decision for fear of influencing me in the wrong direction and so spoiling what she believed to be my happiness she could not even bring herself to forbid me to keep albertine for the time being in our house she did not wish to appear more strict than mme bontemps who was the person principally concerned and who saw no harm in the arrangement which greatly surprised my mother all the same she regretted that she had been obliged to leave us together by departing at that very time for combray where she might have to remain and did in fact remain for months on end during which my great aunt required her incessant attention by day and night everything was made easy for her down there thanks to the kindness the devotion of legrandin who gladly undertaking any trouble that was required kept putting off his return to paris from week to week not that he knew my aunt at all well but simply first of all because she had been his mother s friend and also because he knew that the invalid condemned to die valued his attentions and could not get on without him snobbishness is a serious malady of the spirit but one that is localised and does not taint it as a whole i on the other hand unlike mamma was extremely glad of her absence at combray but for which i should have been afraid being unable to warn albertine not to mention it of her learning of the girl s friendship with mlle vinteuil this would have been to my mother an insurmountable obstacle not merely to a marriage as to which she had for that matter begged me to say nothing definite as yet to albertine and the thought of which was becoming more and more intolerable to myself but even to the latter s being allowed to stay for any length of time in the house apart from so grave a reason which in this case did not apply mamma under the dual influence of my grandmother s liberating and edifying example according to whom in her admiration of george sand virtue consisted in nobility of heart and of my own corruption was now indulgent towards women whose conduct she would have condemned in the past or even now had they been any of her own middle class friends in paris or at combray but whose lofty natures i extolled to her and to whom she pardoned much because of their affection for myself but when all is said and apart from any question of propriety i doubt whether albertine could have put up with mamma who had acquired from combray from my aunt l onie from all her kindred habits of punctuality and order of which my mistress had not the remotest conception she would never think of shutting a door and on the other hand would no more hesitate to enter a room if the door stood open than would a dog or a cat her somewhat disturbing charm was in fact that of taking the place in the household not so much of a girl as of a domestic animal which comes into a room goes out is to be found wherever one does not expect to find it and in her case would bringing me a profound sense of repose come and lie down on my bed by my side make a place for herself from which she never stirred without being in my way as a person would have been she ended however by conforming to my hours of sleep and not only never attempted to enter my room but would take care not to make a sound until i had rung my bell it was fran oise who impressed these rules of conduct upon her she was one of those combray servants conscious of their master s place in the world and that the least that they can do is to see that he is treated with all the respect to which they consider him entitled when a stranger on leaving after a visit gave fran oise a gratuity to be shared with the kitchenmaid he had barely slipped his coin into her hand before fran oise with an equal display of speed discretion and energy had passed the word to the kitchenmaid who came forward to thank him not in a whisper but openly and aloud as fran oise had told her that she must do the parish priest of combray was no genius but he also knew what was due him under his instruction the daughter of some protestant cousins of mme sazerat had been received into the church and her family had been most grateful to him it was a question of her marriage to a young nobleman of m s glise the young man s relatives wrote to inquire about her in a somewhat arrogant letter in which they expressed their dislike of her protestant origin the combray priest replied in such a tone that the m s glise nobleman crushed and prostrate wrote a very different letter in which he begged as the most precious favour the award of the girl s hand in marriage fran oise deserved no special credit for making albertine respect my slumbers she was imbued with tradition from her studied silence or the peremptory response that she made to a proposal to enter my room or to send in some message to me which albertine had expressed in all innocence the latter realised with astonishment that she was now living in an alien world where strange customs prevailed governed by rules of conduct which one must never dream of infringing she had already had a foreboding of this at balbec but in paris made no attempt to resist and would wait patiently every morning for the sound of my bell before venturing to make any noise the training that fran oise gave her was of value also to our old servant herself for it gradually stilled the lamentations which ever since our return from balbec she had not ceased to utter for just as we were boarding the tram she remembered that she had forgotten to say good bye to the housekeeper of the hotel a whiskered dame who looked after the bedroom floors barely knew fran oise by sight but had been comparatively civil to her fran oise positively insisted upon getting out of the tram going back to the hotel saying good bye properly to the housekeeper and not leaving for paris until the following day common sense coupled with my sudden horror of balbec restrained me from granting her this concession but my refusal had infected her with a feverish distemper which the change of air had not sufficed to cure and which lingered on in paris for according to fran oise s code as it is illustrated in the carvings of saint andr des champs to wish for the death of an enemy even to inflict it is not forbidden but it is a horrible sin not to do what is expected of you not to return a civility to refrain like a regular churl from saying good bye to the housekeeper before leaving a hotel throughout the journey the continually recurring memory of her not having taken leave of this woman had dyed fran oise s cheeks with a scarlet flush that was quite alarming and if she refused to taste bite or sup until we reached paris it was perhaps because this memory heaped a regular load upon her stomach every class of society has a pathology of its own even more than with the intention of punishing us among the reasons which led mamma to write me a daily letter and a letter which never failed to include some quotation from mme de s vign there was the memory of my grandmother mamma would write to me mme sazerat gave us one of those little luncheons of which she possesses the secret and which as your poor grandmother would have said quoting mme de s vign deprive us of solitude without affording us company in one of my own earlier letters i was so inept as to write to mamma by those quotations your mother would recognise you at once which brought me three days later the reproof my poor boy if it was only to speak to me of my mother your reference to mme de s vign was most inappropriate she would have answered you as she answered mme de grignan so she was nothing to you i had supposed that you were related by this time i could hear my mistress leaving or returning to her room i rang the bell for it was time now for andr e to arrive with the chauffeur morel s friend lent me by the verdurins to take albertine out i had spoken to the last named of the remote possibility of our marriage but i had never made her any formal promise she herself from discretion when i said to her i can t tell but it might perhaps be possible had shaken her head with a melancholy sigh as much as to say oh no never in other words i am too poor and so while i continued to say it is quite indefinite when speaking of future projects at the moment i was doing everything in my power to amuse her to make life pleasant to her with perhaps the unconscious design of thereby making her wish to marry me she herself laughed at my lavish generosity andr e s mother would be in a fine state if she saw me turn into a rich lady like herself what she calls a lady who has her own horses carriages pictures what did i never tell you that she says that oh she s a character what surprises me is that she seems to think pictures just as important as horses and carriages we shall see in due course that notwithstanding the foolish ways of speaking that she had not outgrown albertine had developed to an astonishing extent which left me unmoved the intellectual superiority of a woman friend having always interested me so little that if i have ever complimented any of my friends upon her own it was purely out of politeness alone the curious genius of c leste might perhaps appeal to me in spite of myself i would continue to smile for some moments when for instance having discovered that fran oise was not in my room she accosted me with heavenly deity reclining on a bed but why c leste i would say why deity oh if you suppose that you have anything in common with the mortals who make their pilgrimage on our vile earth you are greatly mistaken but why reclining on a bed can t you see that i m lying in bed you never lie who ever saw anybody lie like that you have just alighted there with your white pyjamas and the way you twist your neck you look for all the world like a dove albertine even in the discussion of the most trivial matters expressed herself very differently from the little girl that she had been only a few years earlier at balbec she went so far as to declare with regard to a political incident of which she disapproved i consider that ominous and i am not sure that it was not about this time that she learned to say when she meant that she felt a book to be written in a bad style it is interesting but really it might have been written by a pig the rule that she must not enter my room until i had rung amused her greatly as she had adopted our family habit of quotation and in following it drew upon the plays in which she had acted at her convent and for which i had expressed admiration she always compared me to assu rus and death is the reward of whoso dares to venture in his presence unawares none is exempt nor is there any whom or rank or sex can save from such a doom even i myself like all the rest i by this law am bound and to address him i must first be found by him or he must call me to his side physically too she had altered her blue almond shaped eyes grown longer had not kept their form they were indeed of the same colour but seemed to have passed into a liquid state so much so that when she shut them it was as though a pair of curtains had been drawn to shut out a view of the sea it was no doubt this one of her features that i remembered most vividly each night after we had parted for on the contrary every morning the ripple of her hair continued to give me the same surprise as though it were some novelty that i had never seen before and yet above the smiling eyes of a girl what could be more beautiful than that clustering coronet of black violets the smile offers greater friendship but the little gleaming tips of blossoming hair more akin to the flesh of which they seem to be a transposition into tiny waves are more provocative of desire as soon as she entered my room she sprang upon my bed and sometimes would expatiate upon my type of intellect would vow in a transport of sincerity that she would sooner die than leave me this was on mornings when i had shaved before sending for her she was one of those women who can never distinguish the cause of their sensations the pleasure that they derive from a smooth cheek they explain to themselves by the moral qualities of the man who seems to offer them a possibility of future happiness which is capable however of diminishing and becoming less necessary the longer he refrains from shaving i inquired where she was thinking of going i believe andr e wants to take me to the buttes chaumont i have never been there of course it was impossible for me to discern among so many other words whether beneath these a falsehood lay concealed besides i could trust andr e to tell me of all the places that she visited with albertine at balbec when i felt that i was utterly tired of albertine i had made up my mind to say untruthfully to andr e my little andr e if only i had met you again sooner it is you that i would have loved but now my heart is pledged in another quarter all the same we can see a great deal of each other for my love for another is causing me great anxiety and you will help me to find consolation and lo these identical lying words had become true within the space of three weeks perhaps andr e had believed in paris that it was indeed a lie and that i was in love with her as she would doubtless have believed at balbec for the truth is so variable for each of us that other people have difficulty in recognising themselves in it and as i knew that she would tell me everything that she and albertine had done i had asked her and she had agreed to come and call for albertine almost every day in this way i might without anxiety remain at home also andr e s privileged position as one of the girls of the little band gave me confidence that she would obtain everything that i might require from albertine truly i could have said to her now in all sincerity that she would be capable of setting my mind at rest at the same time my choice of andr e who happened to be staying in paris having given up her plan of returning to balbec as guide and companion to my mistress was prompted by what albertine had told me of the affection that her friend had felt for me at balbec at a time when on the contrary i had supposed that i was boring her indeed if i had known this at the time it is perhaps with andr e that i would have fallen in love what you never knew said albertine but we were always joking about it do you mean to say you never noticed how she used to copy all your ways of talking and arguing when she had just been with you it was too obvious she had no need to tell us whether she had seen you as soon as she joined us we could tell at once we used to look at one another and laugh she was like a coalheaver who tries to pretend that he isn t one he is black all over a miller has no need to say that he is a miller you can see the flour all over his clothes and the mark of the sacks he has carried on his shoulder andr e was just the same she would knit her eyebrows the way you do and stretch out her long neck and i don t know what all when i take up a book that has been in your room even if i m reading it out of doors i can tell at once that it belongs to you because it still reeks of your beastly fumigations it s only a trifle still it s rather a nice trifle don t you know whenever anybody spoke nicely about you seemed to think a lot of you andr e was in ecstasies notwithstanding all this in case there might have been some secret plan made behind my back i advised her to give up the buttes chaumont for that day and to go instead to saint cloud or somewhere else it was certainly not as i was well aware because i was the least bit in love with albertine love is nothing more perhaps than the stimulation of those eddies which in the wake of an emotion stir the soul certain such eddies had indeed stirred my soul through and through when albertine spoke to me at balbec about mlle vinteuil but these were now stilled i was no longer in love with albertine for i no longer felt anything of the suffering now healed which i had felt in the tram at balbec upon learning how albertine had spent her girlhood with visits perhaps to montjouvain all this i had too long taken for granted was healed but now and again certain expressions used by albertine made me suppose why i cannot say that she must in the course of her life short as it had been have received declarations of affection and have received them with pleasure that is to say with sensuality thus she would say in any connexion is that true is it really true certainly if she had said like an odette is it really true that thumping lie i should not have been disturbed for the absurdity of the formula would have explained itself as a stupid inanity of feminine wit but her questioning air is that true gave on the one hand the strange impression of a creature incapable of judging things by herself who appeals to you for your testimony as though she were not endowed with the same faculties as yourself if you said to her why we ve been out for a whole hour or it is raining she would ask is that true unfortunately on the other hand this want of facility in judging external phenomena for herself could not be the real origin of her is that true is it really true it seemed rather that these words had been from the dawn of her precocious adolescence replies to you know i never saw anybody as pretty as you you know i am madly in love with you i am most terribly excited affirmations that were answered with a coquettishly consenting modesty by these repetitions of is that true is it really true which no longer served albertine when in my company save to reply by a question to some such affirmation as you have been asleep for more than an hour is that true without feeling that i was the least bit in the world in love with albertine without including in the list of my pleasures the moments that we spent together i was still preoccupied with the way in which she disposed of her time had i not indeed fled from balbec in order to make certain that she could no longer meet this or that person with whom i was so afraid of her misbehaving simply as a joke a joke at my expense perhaps that i had adroitly planned to sever at one and the same time by my departure all her dangerous entanglements and albertine was so entirely passive had so complete a faculty of forgetting things and submitting to pressure that these relations had indeed been severed and i myself relieved of my haunting dread but that dread is capable of assuming as many forms as the undefined evil that is its cause so long as my jealousy was not reincarnate in fresh people i had enjoyed after the passing of my anguish an interval of calm but with a chronic malady the slightest pretext serves to revive it as also with the vice of the person who is the cause of our jealousy the slightest opportunity may serve her to practise it anew after a lull of chastity with different people i had managed to separate albertine from her accomplices and by so doing to exorcise my hallucinations even if it was possible to make her forget people to cut short her attachments her sensual inclination was itself also chronic and was perhaps only waiting for an opportunity to afford itself an outlet now paris provided just as many opportunities as balbec in any town whatsoever she had no need to seek for the evil existed not in albertine alone but in others to whom any opportunity for enjoyment is good a glance from one understood at once by the other brings the two famished souls in contact and it is easy for a clever woman to appear not to have seen then five minutes later to join the person who has read her glance and is waiting for her in a side street and in a few words to make an appointment who will ever know and it was so simple for albertine to tell me in order that she might continue these practices that she was anxious to see again some place on the outskirts of paris that she had liked and so it was enough that she should return later than usual that her expedition should have taken an unaccountable time although it was perfectly easy perhaps to account for it without introducing any sensual reason for my malady to break out afresh attached this time to mental pictures which were not of balbec and which i would set to work as with their predecessors to destroy as though the destruction of an ephemeral cause could put an end to a congenital malady i did not take into account the fact that in these acts of destruction in which i had as an accomplice in albertine her faculty of changing her ability to forget almost to hate the recent object of her love i was sometimes causing a profound grief to one or other of those persons unknown with whom in turn she had taken her pleasure and that this grief i was causing them in vain for they would be abandoned replaced and parallel to the path strewn with all the derelicts of her light hearted infidelities there would open for me another pitiless path broken only by an occasional brief respite so that my suffering could end only with albertine s life or with my own even in the first days after our return to paris not satisfied by the information that andr e and the chauffeur had given me as to their expeditions with my mistress i had felt the neighbourhood of paris to be as tormenting as that of balbec and had gone off for a few days in the country with albertine but everywhere my uncertainty as to what she might be doing was the same the possibility that it was something wrong as abundant vigilance even more difficult with the result that i returned with her to paris in leaving balbec i had imagined that i was leaving gomorrah plucking albertine from it in reality alas gomorrah was dispersed to all the ends of the earth and partly out of jealousy partly out of ignorance of such joys a case which is rare indeed i had arrange,"['threat', 'page', 'nurse',

having considered some of the more important arguments and observations that have been advanced to prove the existence or non existence of the unicorn we may now assume the role of the sceptic who regards the whole legend as probably a product of the fancy asking ourselves how the belief first arose this question plunges us at once into the remote past it forces us to think as much as possible in the way of men whose mental habit was very different from our own it is a question therefore to which no conclusive answer carrying final conviction to all can be expected i shall arrange my conjectures in the order of plausibility passing from those one feels tempted to accept immediately to others that may seem at first highly dubious several authoritative scholars have held that the unicorn legend derives entirely from oriental beliefs about the rhinoceros this was the opinion of cuvier for example a man whose expert knowledge and good sense command respect and it is an opinion in keeping with the tendency of our time to prefer the light of common day to the light that never was an impressive case can be made out for this view we have repeatedly seen the rhinoceros crossing the unicorn s path or plunging through the undergrowth in a direction remarkably parallel ctesias aelian pliny and isidore mingle large ingredients of rhinoceros with their unicorns learned christian fathers such as tertuillan jerome ambrose and gregory reject the unicorn entirely in favour of his doppelganger and later scholars had to exert constant effort to prevent the animal from slipping down or back into the huge indian hog and this is not surprising when one considers that almost exactly the same beliefs were held in india about the one animal as those entertained in europe about the other and that from the beginning of the sixteenth century portuguese commerce made possible a constant infiltration of oriental superstitions into the western world we cannot ignore the fact that western interest in the alicorn increased at just the time when this infiltration began and that rhinoceros horns were actually used in europe although to no great extent precisely as alicorns were a curious illustration of the uncertainty regarding the true horn is seen in the fact that the treasury of st mark s in venice contains beside the two famous alicorns brought from constantinople and another one of later acquisition the unmistakable horn of a rhinoceros hanging with them in this way the cathedral assured itself against error however the learned might eventually decide the parallelism between the two traditions may be shown in the words of a famous traveller of the sixteenth century linschoeten says of the rhinoceros that some think it is the right unicorne because that as yet there hath no other bin found but only by hearesay and by the pictures of them the portingalles and those of bengala affirme that by the river ganges in the kingdome of bengala are many of these rhinoceros which when they will drinke the other beasts stand and waite upon them till the rhinoceros hath drinke and thrust their horne into the water for he cannot drinke but his horne must be under the water because it standeth so close unto his nose and muzzle and then after him all the other beastes doe drinke their hornes in india are much esteemed and used against all venime poyson and many other diseases which is very good and most true as i myselfe by experience have found after reading this passage one is disposed to agree with the assertion of de laborde that the rhinoceros is the sole source of all the marvellous qualities attributed to the unicorn one is not surprised to find that conrad gesner used durer s famous drawing of the rhinoceros as the illustration accompanying his account of the monoceros or that john of san geminiano could say christus assimilatur rhinocerote arabian writers constantly described the one animal under the name of the other and in europe there seems never to have been a time when some one did not suspect that the two were identical it is true that those who thought thus had always vigorous opponents andrea bacci disposed of the notion to his own satisfaction by pointing out that the romans knew the rhinoceros perfectly and yet believed in the unicorn as a totally different animal he found the horns of the two animals in the treasury of don francesco and characterized that of the rhinoceros a beast that he seems to have regarded with contempt as black and thick and vulgar julius caesar scaliger fell foul of cardan in this fashion by what evil fate does it happen that in spite of the frequent beatings you receive from the rods of grammarians you must now fall under the censure of naturalists there is no help for you cardan when you describe the monoceros under the heading of rhinoceros for these two animals are entirely different this serious charge like many another that scaliger brought against his foe was unjustified for cardan had said with all possible clearness that the two animals were quite distinct and that nothing but the vague similarity in their names had caused confusion but the most amusing of all those who strove to defend the unicorn from this contamination was luis de urreta i have already quoted the passage in which he describes what he calls the unicorn in terms that apply exclusively to the rhinoceros and then refers with an indulgent smile to the belief of certain holy men who could not be expected to know better that the two animals were really the same these passages show that the rhinoceros was as mysterious in europe as the unicorn itself familiar to the romans of the empire it was remembered in the middle ages chiefly because of a few references in martial and other ancient writers for a thousand years europe forgot what the rhinoceros looks like there is to be sure a curious little figure in the pavement of st mark s at venice near the door of the madonna which seems when one first comes upon it to contradict this statement this figure the original of which seems to have been placed here in the thirteenth century shows the unmistakable head of the rhinoceros with the horn properly placed although the body is that of a bear the feet are furnished with claws and the ears are very large and shaped like those of a bat the more learned cicerones of st mark s always refer to this pavement mosaic as the rhinoceros under the palmtree explaining that it symbolizes the wrath of god but they do not tell us why the rhinoceros should stand so near the madonna s door or how a mosaicist of the thirteenth century happened to know even thus much about the appearance of an indian beast hazardous as it may seem my conjecture is that the mosaicist did not intend to represent a rhinoceros at all but a unicorn for an accurate description of the unicorn it is not unreasonable to suppose that he went to his contemporary and fellow townsman ser marco polo recently returned from india where he had seen the rhinoceros in the wild state and had come away with the belief that he had seen the unicorn although he had to admit book iii chapter that it is not in the least like that which our stories tell of as being caught in the lap of a virgin in fact tis altogether different from what we fancied the first rhinoceros seen in western europe in modern times was brought round cape horn in and taken to lisbon the second much better known and indeed a celebrated animal arrived in the same city seventeen years later where it became a great favourite at the palace of the king and on one occasion was pitted against an elephant which it put to ignominious flight a sketch of it sent to albrecht d rer was converted into the well known engraving delightfully inaccurate which did duty for more than a hundred years in books of zoology in this rhinoceros whose name should have been ulysses set forth once more for rome intended as a gift to the pope but his ship was wrecked off marseilles and in spite of his gallant effort to swim ashore only the dead body was recovered the skin was stuffed and sent to the palace of the king of france it was a hundred and fifty years after this that england first acquired a live rhinoceros of her own some of the traits ascribed to the unicorn were almost certainly derived from facts observed by hunters of the rhinoceros the hide of this beast is impervious to primitive weapons so that the belief might well get abroad that it could be taken or killed only by stratagem the people of india and china have long thought indeed that their beakers of rhinoceros horn were made of the horns of animals killed by elephants until the invention of the modern rifle the indian rhinoceros had been killed or captured chiefly by great drives such as that led by tamerlane in which many men and horses took part although not very swift of foot the rhinoceros runs more rapidly than its bulk would lead one to expect and it begins slowly as early writers said of the unicorn increasing its speed little by little with reference to the western belief that the virgin decoy attracts her victim by her odour it is worthy of remark that the eyesight of the rhinoceros is weak and his sense of smell very keen the repeated statements that the unicorn belongs in some sense to the king reminds one that even in modern times eastern potentates have been known to keep the rhinoceros in their parks and to take him with them on royal progresses as a symbol of power and sovereignty just as the unicorn came to represent chastity and solitude in europe and became especially dear therefore to christian monks so the rhinoceros symbolized chastity and solitude in india and was regarded as a model of the ascetic life alkazuwin says concerning the animal s solitude that when it has chosen a grazing ground it will not tolerate the presence of any other beast within one hundred parasangs on any side and those who know the literature of solitude will understand how readily this trait would be accepted by the forest hermits as a mark of holiness and wisdom finally there is to be considered the tradition of the unicorn s great strength which persisted even when the animal was likened by physiologus to a kid does it not seem probable that there is some memory here of the elephant fighter joshua sylvester after speaking in high commendation of the elephant proceeds as follows but his huge strength nor subtle witt can not defend him from the sly rhinocerot who never with blinde furie led doth venter upon his foe but yer the lists he enter against a rock he whetteth round about the dangerous pike upon his armed snout then buckling close doth not at random hack on the hard cuirasse of his enemies back but under s belie cunning findes a skinne whear and but thear his sharpened blade will in even more is claimed for the rhinoceros on the score of medicinal value than for the unicorn for not his horn alone but his entire body is held to abound with magical virtues these virtues it would seem were regarded as merely brought to a higher potency in the horn according to a belief that his strength chiefly lay in the member with which he fought and defended himself the hunting transport preparation and sale of these horns has been one of the more romantic details of oriental business activity for a very long time comparable only so far as the east is concerned with the commerce in dragon s bones there are even records showing that occidental merchants shared in this business lying in the strait of malacca in james lancaster sent commodities to the king of junsaloam to barter for ambergriese and for the hornes of the abath whereof the king only hath the traffique in his hands now this abath is a beast which hath one horn onely in her forehead and is thought to be the female unicorne and is highly esteemed of all the moores in these parts as a most soveraigne remedie against poyson caspar bartholinus tells us that when he was in italy about the year the rhinoceros horn was on sale in several of the larger cities and that it was recommended as a specific against poison and fevers small pox epilepsy vertigo worms impotence and stomachache forty years later father lobo could say that this horn as compared with true alicorn was not so sovereign though used against poison pierre pomet writing in asserts that the rhinoceros horn is still used in the belief that it is as effective as alicorn this is what one would expect but it is a little surprising to find precisely the same set of beliefs at the cape of good hope in the eighteenth century applied there to the white rhinoceros whether to attribute this to a prehistoric transmission across the length of africa or to the influence of the dutch and portuguese one is not quite sure charles thunberg writes that in the region of the cape the horns of the rhinoceros were kept not only as rarities but also as useful in diseases and for the purpose of detecting poison the fine shavings of the horns taken internally were supposed to cure convulsions and spasms in children and it was firmly believed that goblets made of these horns in a turner s lathe would discover a poisonous draught by making the liquor ferment with these facts and considerations in mind one is strongly inclined to agree with de laborde that the rhinoceros is the sole source not only of the superstition regarding the alicorn but of the whole unicorn legend before committing oneself to the rhinoceros theory however there are a few questions that one would like to have answered how did the unicorn acquire from this animal so mild and phlegmatic when not molested his reputation for extreme pugnacity does it seem likely that the rhinoceros suggested the unicorn s reputation for extreme fleetness with the rhinoceros alone in mind what sense can we make of topsell s assertion founded upon good ancient authority that the unicorn fighteth with the mouth and with the heels with the mouth biting like a lion and with the heels kicking like a horse again what is the connection between the rhinoceros and the unicorn of physiologus of which we are told that it is like a kid finally how is it possible to identify an animal of such delicacy and refinement as the unicorn s with the gross grunting slime wallowing rhinoceros one hesitates to think of him as related to that beast even in the way that the water lily is related to the mud looking for a way of escape from the almost inescapable evidence accumulated above one recalls that the rhinoceros was not the only one horned animal known to or imagined by the ancients both pliny and aristotle believed that the oryx was a unicorn this animal as we learn from oppian s poem on the art of hunting was regarded in the ancient world as extremely formidable both to man and beast although it does not look much like a goat to the modern eye the ancients with their loose zoological terminology sometimes called it that and certainly it is far more goat like than the rhinoceros the oryx or rather a bronze figure of one was probably the original of the drawing of a monoceros preserved in an early manuscript of cosmas indicopleustes the nimble and delicate unicorns of mediaeval manuscripts are all of the same general kind that is they are all vaguely like antelopes the painted figure of a unicorn found by sir john barrow in a south african cave was clearly that of some sort of antelope the descriptions of unicorns left us by vartoman thevet lobo francis magellanes caravaial ruppell and several others suggest the oryx strongly and in one of these descriptions that of magellanes the same assertions are made regarding the medicinal value of the horn as those with which we are familiar the horn of the rhinoceros was not the only one with which this superstition was connected so that de laborde may be wrong after all in asserting that it was the source of the whole belief concerning the alicorn aelian tells us that it was a custom of ancient hunters to reserve the oryxes they captured as presents for their kings it will be recalled that we have already been obliged to call in a large antelope of some sort to explain the unicorn of ctesias in short almost if not quite as much may be said for the oryx as for the rhinoceros by one trying to find the source of the unicorn legend almost as much has in fact been said samuel bochart devoted twenty folio pages of amazing erudition to an attempt to prove that both the re em and the unicorn derive from the oryx basing his argument upon a firm belief for which he had the authority of aristotle and pliny that all oryxes are one horned such are the charming results of studying zoology in libraries professor martin lichtenstein of berlin a far less learned man but better acquainted with antelopes supported the oryx theory by citation of egyptian monuments he reproduced a mural decoration found in the pyramid at memphis showing five antelopes one of them certainly intended as a unicorn led by human figures the whole scene representing a ritualistic offering in another plate shown by lichtenstein we see a god with a saw in one hand holding a one horned antelope by the other and the suggestion is that one of the horns has just been cut off the antelope here shown is apparently the small and graceful dorcas sacred to isis and it is significant therefore that in this second plate the god and the antelope stand before that goddess enthroned we may perhaps draw the inference that isis preferred to have her antelopes appear before her with one horn although lichtenstein does not mention the fact one cannot help remembering in this connection that the early christians of alexandria transferred to the virgin mary some of the attributes of isis the egyptian mother of god and that even the conventional christian paintings of mother and child are sometimes said to have had this pagan origin a question grazes the mind whether we have found here the channel by which a heathen superstition was diverted to the uses of christian symbolism this question arises with unusual emphasis when one stands before the beautiful painting of the madonna and child by stefan lochner in the wallraf richartz museum at cologne on the madonna s bosom there is a large jewelled brooch which shows in the middle a seated maiden with a unicorn resting in her lap here at any rate we have a unicorn vaguely simile haedo which belongs to the country of physiologus and is in some way related to a goddess who in spite of her own practice of incest was regarded as a patroness of chastity bochart s argument would have been stronger if he had admitted a possibility that other antelopes beside the large and fierce oryx may have had some influence upon the unicorn legend the dorcas is a smaller and more kid like animal altogether a more appropriate companion for virgins seated in the woods as we shall see both pallas and cuvier admit that the oryx may now and then as a lusus nafurae have only one horn and far more frequent than such sports must be the animals that have had one horn broken off in conflict with their fellows the most important consideration is however that when seen in profile the oryx really seems to have only one horn a fact to which there is abundant testimony and which anyone can test for himself by visiting a large menagerie the pertinence of this fact is made clear in a communication that appeared recently in a daily newspaper referring to the report that the present duke of gloucester had shot an oryx in tanganyika territory the correspondent writes the african even when he is a professional hunter is not anything of a naturalist one day a man passed me carrying in the manner of a sceptre or wand of office a long straight horn i asked my african companion about the horn and was assured that it was a very rare trophy indeed it came off a great antelope that was only to be found and then but rarely in the desert country far to the north when i asked whether the owner would not be better off with the two horns instead of with only half a pair my companion said that the remarkable beast which provided the horn carried only one some time later i moved to a part of the country where oryx were to be found the animal is a very shy beast not easy to approach from a distance and especially when broadside on he certainly appears to have only one horn moreover the first i saw head on had in fact only one horn but when i managed to drop that oryx and looked him over i found that though the beast had only one horn he had had two there was a stump of the second just where one would expect it male antelopes at times bicker with one another and they do it with their horns one can hear the rattle of them as their wearers battle together in a bout of the sort the long slender horn is apt to snap off and that no doubt was how the single horned oryx came to be perhaps it was by some such means that the fabulous unicorn found its way into heraldry discoveries of this sort are made many times before they become common property sir william cornwallis harris made much the same remarks about the oryx seventy years ago but with important variations his passage though wretchedly written and full of errors in statement of fact deserves partial quotation romance says he aiding the skilful hand of nature with her richest embroidery has succeeded in investing the group to which the oryx belongs with a degree of interest that few other quadrupeds can claim the figure of the renowned unicorn can be seen traced in all the ancient carvings coins and latin heraldic insignia and from our earliest childhood the form of that fabled animal has been made to occupy so prominent a place in our juvenile imaginations that arriving at years of discretion we are still almost tempted to regard it as a creature having actual existence of all the whimsies of antiquity the unicorn unquestionably the most celebrated is the chimera which has in modern ages engrossed the largest portion of attention from the curious the alterations required to reduce the african oryx to the standard of the heraldic unicorn are slight and simple nor can it be doubted that they have been gradually introduced by successive copyists the idea of the single horn being derived from profile representations of that animal in hasrelief on the sculptured monuments of ancient egypt and nubia excepting in the position and forward inclination of the horn the cartazon of the ancient persians figured on the monuments of persepolis and described by aelian tallies in every respect so exactly with the algazel or north african oryx as the latter would appear en profile with the straight and almost parallel horns precisely covering each other that little question can exist as to that animal having furnished the origin of the design accident may indeed have contributed to strengthen the opinion once conceived of the existence of the monocerine species for it is well known that among the savage tribes of africa the art of twirling carving and otherwise adorning the horns of their domestic animals was carried to a singular extent the most fanciful forms being imparted and the two even sometimes twisted together it is however unnecessary to look beyond the ignorance of the limner and the credulity of the describer satisfactorily to trace the progress of the whole delusion both the oryx and the wild ass inhabit the same regions and possess in common the essential attributes of figure colour and carriage nor is it at all unlikely that the mutilation of individuals of the first named species by the fracture of a horn may afterwards have tended to strengthen the belief derived from these imperfect representations such would appear to have been the origin and progress of the fable of the unicorn from its foundation in ancient persia to its diffusion over the whole of western europe and such at the present day is the figure of the fictitious animal forming the sinister supporter of the royal achievement of england the author s painting of the oryx which accompanies this text is more convincing than the text itself already it begins to appear that the difficulty in finding the source of the unicorn legend does not lie in poverty of materials or lack of plausible theories quite as convincing an argument can be made for the oryx as for the rhinoceros indeed a somewhat better one by the test of physiologus and either argument looks cogent and final when separately considered from this fact there seem to be three possible inferences that the two bodies of belief grew up independently that the beliefs relating to one of the two animals have been transferred to the other that both legends are derived from a body of belief lying farther back in time the first of these possibilities seems to me so nearly impossible that i shall waste no space upon it the second although certainly arguable presents numerous difficulties which i think could not be overcome one can hardly think for example that the medicinal attributes of the rhinoceros could be transferred to the antelope without the transfer of some of its more obvious physical characteristics of which the unicorn of physiologus and of europe is entirely devoid neither does it seem probable that the great prestige of the unicorn and of the treasure of his brow could have been derived from either of these animals we are left then with the third possibility that the rhinoceros and oryx legends are indeed related though not in the sense that one is the parent of the other they have a common ancestor some greater unicorn looms behind them both we must continue the quest it was said of cuvier that he could reconstruct the skeleton of a prehistoric animal from a single knuckle bone and there is just a possibility that the popular imagination has built up the unicornnot the various items of his legend and of what may be called his character alone for these are obviously products of fancy but his physical aspect on the basis of a horn which never grew on his brow a remarkable horn or an object everywhere so called did certainly attract much attention in the middle ages and there can be little doubt what sort of object this was representations of it in mediaeval manuscripts show that it had precisely those anfractuous spires and cochleary turnings which i see in the ivory stick on the desk before me and which are to be found in no other natural object this ivory stick is perfectly straight suggesting that it grew single and alone as indeed it did as i have already said the italian word licorno the horn was almost certainly made at a time when the object was regarded as independent and no origin for it had been imagined the rather awkward extension of this word to name the beast from whose brow the horn was supposed to spring suggests that the animal was deduced from the horn if this could happen in italy during the middle ages it may have happened elsewhere and much earlier we do not know for how long such objects as my alicorn have been familiar in mediterranean countries but the commercial history of the race that chiefly purveyed them stretches back for a very long time furthermore it is not necessary to this conjecture that the kind of horn before me and no other should have always served to suggest the unicorn there are several horns particularly those of certain antelopes so straight and apparently independent as to suggest when seen singly that they grew alone it is a matter not of conjecture but of fact that the single straight horns of antelopes have been used in tibet during many centuries for magical and ritualistic purposes and that these sacred horns have been dispersed by pilgrims over a wide territory acquiring more and more as they went farther from their source the reputation of talismans and of being the horns of unicorns here we see a unicorn legend in the making the highly significant passage that i have quoted from colonel prejevalsky shows all the essential phases of the unicorn legend assembled in tibet and it shows also how they might be put together we start to be sure with an actual animal sacred and taboo its blood is thought to be medicinal its long straight horn is used by priests in necromatic and religious rites it has some sort of symbolism in this same region there has been since the time of genghis khan and probably for very much longer a belief in onehorned antelopes the priests who use the horns in divination may know that they grew in pairs although they use them singly but the pilgrims who buy these horns and carry them into the surrounding districts are probably not aware of this at a distance from the distributing centre everyone is convinced that they are the horns of unicorns the representations of salesmen praising their wares tend to increase belief in the magic powers of the horns and this belief grows as it spreads west and east tibet lies between persia from which we get our first notices of the western unicorn and china which has a highly developed unicorn legend not of native origin tibet was included in the india of ctesias why should we look farther for the sources of the unicorn there is a possibility however and one that must not be ignored that unicorned animals actually exist in rare instances as lusus naturae this possibility was urged by peter simon pallas one of the most competent zoologists of the eighteenth century who believed that the legend of the unicorn sprang from chance encounters with such one horned sports the theory is not unattractive accounting as it does for the universal belief that the unicorn is exceedingly rare and also for the facts that it has been reported from many different parts of the world and has been described as resembling a wide variety of animals a nineteenth century scholar points out that there are antelopes whose horns are joined for the first few inches from the base and he asks what is to prevent nature from prolonging this juncture now and then and as a freak throughout the entire length these speculations are brought into the region of fact by an authentic record of a onehorned animal in his natural history of oxfordshire robert plot describes several sheep with six or eight horns kept in his time by lord norreys at ridcot and there was one other sheep says he that excelled them all in being a unicorn having a single horn growing in the middle of its forehead twenty one inches long with annulary protuberances round it and a little twisted in the middle there was to be sure another little horn growing on the same head but so inconsiderable that it was hid under the wool this oxfordshire unicorn seems to have been a freak but others have been produced artificially by the deliberate man handling of horns of which there has been a good deal early and late in various parts of the world among us says a modern writer the horn does not seem capable of much modification but a kaffir can never be content to leave the horns as they are he will cause one horn to project forward and the other backward now and then an ox is seen in which a most singular effect has been produced as the horns of the young ox sprout they are trained over the forehead until the points meet they are then manipulated so as to make them coalesce and so shoot upwards from the middle of the forehead like the horn of the fabled unicorn this passage is corroborated by another in a more recent book which seems to bring the unicorn almost to one s door few domestic sheep are more remarkable or have given rise to more controversy than the indian one horned or unicorn sheep of which the first living specimens ever seen in this country formed part of a large collection of nepalese animals presented to king george v when prince of wales that were exhibited at the london zoological gardens in the year although receiving the name of unicorn sheep these animals really possessed a pair of horns for if we examine one of their skulls and remove the horn sheath from its bony support it will be noticed that the latter is composed of two quite separate structures there appears to be a certain amount of mystery regarding the origin of these creatures and some doubt as to whether their peculiar horn formation is not the outcome of artificial manipulation a letter from the british resident at the court of nepal is then quoted in which these words occur there is no special breed of one horned sheep in nepal nor are the specimens which have been brought here for sale natural freaks by certain maltreatment ordinary two horned sheep are converted into a one horned variety the process adopted is branding with a red hot iron the male lambs

nu uman and his sons sharrkan and zau al makan and what befel them of things seld seen and peregrine fn the king asked her and what was their story and she answered it hath reached me o auspicious king that there was in the city of safety baghdad before the caliphate of abd al malik bin marw n fn a king omar bin al nu um n highs who was of the mighty giants and had subjected the chosro s of persia and the kaysars of eastern rome for none could warm himself at his fire fn nor could any avail to meet him in the field of foray and fray and when he was angered there came forth from his nostrils sparks of flame he had made himself king over all quarters and allah had subjected to him all his creatures his word went forth to all great cities and his hosts had harried the farthest lands east and west had come under his command with whatsoever regions lay interspersed between them hind and sind and sin fn the holy land al hijaz the rich mountains of al yaman and the archipelagos of india and china moreover he reigned supreme over the north country and diy r bakr or mesopotamia and over sud n the eastern negro land and the islands of the ocean and all the far famed rivers of the earth sayh n and jayh n fn nile and euphrates he sent envoys and ambassadors to capitals the most remote to provide him with true report and they would bring back tidings of justice and peace with assurance of loyalty and obedience and of prayers in the pulpits for king omar bin al nu uman for he was o ruler of the age a right noble king and there came to him presents of rarities and toll and tribute from all lands of his governing this mighty monarch had a son yclept sharrkan fn who was likest of all men to his father and who proved himself one of the prodigies of his time for subduing the brave and bringing his contemporaries to bane and ban for this his father loved him with love so great none could be greater and made him heir to the kingdom after himself this prince grew up till he reached man s estate and was twenty years old and allah subjected his servants to him by reason of his great might and prowess in battle now his father king omar had four wives legally married but allah had vouchsafed him no son by them save sharrkan whom he had begotten upon one of them and the rest were barren moreover he had three hundred and sixty concubines after the number of days in the coptic year who were of all nations and he had furnished for each and every a private chamber within his own palace for he had built twelve pavilions after the number of the months each containing thirty private chambers which thus numbered three hundred and three score wherein he lodged his handmaids and he appointed according to law for each one her night when he lay with her and came not again to her for a full year fn and on this wise he abode for a length of time meanwhile his son sharrkan was making himself renowned in all quarters of the world and his father was proud of him and his might waxed and grew mightier so that he passed all bounds and bore himself masterfully and took by storm castles and cities presently by decree of the decreer a handmaid among the handmaids of omar bin nu uman became pregnant and her pregnancy being announced to the harim the king was informed thereof whereupon he rejoiced with exceeding joy and said haply it will be a son and so all my offspring will be males then he documented the date of her conception and entreated her with all manner of kindness but when the tidings came to sharrkan he was troubled and the matter seemed to him a sore one and a grievous and he said verily one cometh who shall dispute with me the sovereignty so quoth he to himself if this concubine bear a male child i will kill it but he kept that intention hidden in his heart such was the case with sharrkan but what happened in the matter of the damsel was as follows she was a roumiyah a greek girl by name sofiyah or sophia fn whom the king of roum and lord of c sarea had sent to king omar as a present together with great store of gifts and of rarities she was the fairest of favour and loveliest of all his handmaids and the most regardful of her honour and she was gifted with a wit as penetrating as her presence was fascinating now she had served the king on the night of his sleeping with her saying to him o king i desire of the god of the heavens that he bless thee this night with a male child by me so i may bring him up with the best of rearing and enable him to reach man s estate perfect in intelligence good manners and prudent bearing fn a speech which much pleased the king during her pregnancy she was instant in prayer fervently supplicating the lord to bless her with a goodly male child and make his birth easy to her and allah heard her petition so that after her months were accomplished she sat safely upon the birth stool fn now the king had deputed a eunuch to let him know if the child she should bring forth were male or female and in like way his son sharrkan had sent one to bring him tidings of the same in due time sophia was delivered of a child which the midwives examined and found to be a girl with a face sheenier than the moon so they announced this to all present in the room whereupon the king s messenger carried the news to him and sharrkan s eunuch did the like with his master who rejoiced with exceeding joy but after the two had departed quoth sophia to the midwives wait with me awhile for i feel as if there were still somewhat in my womb then she cried out and the pains of child bed again took her and allah made it easy to her and she gave birth to a second child the wise women looked at it and found it a boy like the full moon with forehead flower white and cheek ruddy bright with rosy light whereupon the mother rejoiced as did the eunuchs and attendants and all the company and sophia was delivered of the after birth whilst all in the palace sent forth the trill of joy fn the rest of the concubines heard it and envied her lot and the tidings reached omar son of al nu uman who was glad and rejoiced at the excellent news then he rose and went to her and kissed her head after which he looked at the boy and bending over him kissed him whilst the damsels struck the tabors and played on instruments of music and the king gave order that the boy should be named zau al mak n and his sister nuzhat al zam n fn they answered hearing and obedience and did his bidding so he appointed wet nurses and dry nurses and eunuchs and attendants to serve them and assigned them rations of sugar and diet drinks and unguents and else beside beyond the power of tongue to rehearse moreover the people of baghdad hearing that allah had blessed their king with issue decorated the city and made proclamation of the glad tidings with drum and tom tom and the emirs and wazirs and high dignitaries came to the palace and wished king omar bin al nu uman joy of his son zau al makan and of his daughter nuzhat al zaman wherefore he thanked them and bestowed on them dresses of honour and further favoured them with gifts and dealt largesse to all gentle and simple who were present after this fashion he did for four days full told and he lavished upon sophia raiment and ornaments and great store of wealth and every few days he would send a messenger to ask after her and the new borns and when four years had gone by he provided her with the wherewithal to rear the two children carefully and educate them with the best of instructions all this while his son sharrkan knew not that a male child had been born to his father omar son of al nu uman having news only that he had been blessed with the birth of nuzhat al zaman and they hid the intelligence from him until days and years had sped by whilst he was busied in battling with the brave and fighting single handed against the knights one day as king omar was sitting in his palace his chamberlains came in to him and kissing the ground before him said o king there be come ambassadors from the king of roum lord of constantinople the great and they desire admission to thee and submission to thy decree if the king commend us to introduce them we will so do and if not there is no disputing his behest he bade them enter and when they came in he turned to them and courteously receiving them asked them of their case and what was the cause of their coming they kissed the ground before him and said o king glorious and strong o lord of the arm that is long know that he who despatched us to thee is king afr d n fn lord of ionia land fn and of the nazarene armies the sovereign who is firmly established in the empery of constantinople to acquaint thee that he is now waging fierce war and fell with a tyrant and a rebel the prince of casarea and the cause of this war is as follows one of the kings of the arabs in past time during certain of his conquests chanced upon a hoard of the time of alexander fn whence he removed wealth past compute and amongst other things three round jewels big as ostrich eggs from a mine of pure white gems whose like was never seen by man upon each were graven characts in ionian characters and they have many virtues and properties amongst the rest that if one of these jewels be hung round the neck of a new born child no evil shall befal him and he shall neither wail nor shall fever ail him as long as the jewel remain without fail fn when the arab king laid hands upon them and learned their secrets he sent to king afridun presents of certain rarities and amongst them the three jewels afore mentioned and he equipped for the mission two ships one bearing the treasure and the other men of might to guard it from any who might offer hindrance on the high seas albeit well assured that none would dare waylay his vessels for that he was king of the arabs and more by token that their course lay over waters subject to the king of constantinople and they were bound to his port nor were there on the shores of that sea any save the subjects of the great king afridun the two ships set out and voyaged till they drew near our city when there sallied out on them certain corsairs from that country and amongst them troops from the prince of caesarea who took all the treasures and rarities in the ships together with the three jewels and slew the crews when our king heard of this he sent an army against them but they routed it then he marched a second and a stronger but they put this also to flight whereupon the king waxed wroth and swore that he would not go forth fn against them save in his own person at the head of his whole army nor would he turn back from them till he had left caesarea of armenia fn in ruins and had laid waste all the lands and cities over which her prince held sway so he sent us to the lord of the age and the time sultan omar bin al nu uman king of baghdad and of khorasan desiring that he aid us with an army so may honour and glory accrue to him and he hath also forwarded by us somewhat of various kinds of presents and of the king s grace he beggeth their acceptance and the friendly boon of furtherance then the ambassadors kissed the ground before him and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say when it was the forty sixth night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that after the ambassadors and retinue from the constantinopolitan king had kissed the ground before omar and had delivered their embassage they brought out the presents which were fifty damsels of the choicest from graecia land and fifty mamelukes in tunics of brocade belted with girdles of gold and silver each wearing in his ears hoops of gold with pendants of fine pearls costing a thousand ducats every one the girls were adorned in like fashion and were clad in stuffs worth a treasury of money when the king saw them he rejoiced in them and accepted them then he bade the ambassadors be honourably entreated and summoning his wazirs took counsel with them of what he should do herewith rose up among them a wazir an ancient man dandan fn highs who kissed the ground before omar and said o king there is nothing better to do in this matter than equip an army valiant and victorious and set over it thy son sharrkan with us as his lieutenants and this rede commendeth itself to me on two counts first because the king of roum hath invoked thine assistance and hath sent thee gifts which thou hast accepted and secondly because while no enemy dareth attack our country thine army may go forth safely and should it succour the king of graecia land and defeat his foe the glory will be thine moreover the news of it will be noised abroad in all cities and countries and especially when the tidings shall reach the islands of the ocean and the kings of mauritania shall hear it they will send thee offerings of rarities and pay thee tribute of money the king pleased by the wazir s words and approving his rede gave him a dress of honour and said to him of the like of thee should kings ask counsel and it seemeth fit that thou shouldst conduct the van of our army and our son sharrkan command the main battle then he sent for his son who came and kissed ground before him and sat down and he expounded to him the matter telling him what the ambassadors and the wazir dandan had said and he charged him to take arms and equip himself for the campaign enjoining him not to gainsay dandan in aught he should do moreover he ordered him to pick out of his army ten thousand horsemen armed cap pie and inured to onset and stress of war accordingly sharrkan arose on the instant and chose out a myriad of horsemen after which he entered his palace and mustered his host and distributed largesse to them saying ye have delay of three days they kissed the earth before him in obedience to his commands and began at once to lay in munitions and provide provisions for the occasion whilst sharrkan repaired to the armouries and took therefrom whatsoever he required of arms and armour and thence to the stable where he chose horses of choice blood and others when the appointed three days were ended the army drew out to the suburbs of baghdad city fn and king omar came forth to take leave of his son who kissed the ground before him and received from the king seven parcels of money fn then he turned to danden and commended to his care the army of his son and the wazir kissed the ground before him and answered i hear and i obey and lastly he charged sharrkan that he should consult the wazir on all occasions which he promised to do after this the king returned to his city and sharrkan ordered the officers to muster their troops in battle array so they mustered them and their number was ten thousand horsemen besides footmen and camp followers then they loaded their baggage on their beasts and the war drums beat and the trumpets blared and the bannerols and standards were unfurled whilst sharrkan mounted horse with the wazir dandan by his side and the colours fluttering over their heads so the host fared forth and stinted not faring with the ambassadors preceding them till day departed and night drew nigh when they alighted and encamped for the night and as soon as allah caused the morn tomorrow they mounted and tried on guided by the ambassadors for a space of twenty days and by the night of the twenty first they came to a fine and spacious wady well grown with trees and shrubbery here sharrkan ordered them to alight and commanded a three days halt so they dismounted and pitched their tents spreading their camp over the right and the left slopes of the extensive valley whilst the wazir dandan and the ambassadors of king afridun pitched in the sole of the wady fn as for sharrkan he tarried behind them for awhile till all had dismounted and had dispersed themselves over the valley sides he then slacked the reins of his steed being minded to explore the wady and to mount guard in his own person because of his father s charge and owing to the fact that they were on the frontier of graecia land and in the enemy s country so he rode out alone after ordering his armed slaves and his body guard to camp near the wazir dandan and he fared on along the side of the valley till a fourth part of the night was passed when he felt tired and drowsiness overcame him so that he could no longer urge horse with heel now he was accustomed to take rest on horseback so when slumber overpowered him he slept and the steed ceased not going on with him till half the night was spent and entered one of the thickets fn which was dense with growth but sharrkan awoke not until his horse stumbled over wooded ground then he started from sleep and found himself among the trees and the moon arose and shone brightly over the two horizons eastern and western he was startled when he found himself alone in this place and said the say which ne er yet shamed its sayer there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great but as he rode on in fear of wild beasts behold the moon spread her glad light over a meadow as if it were of the meads of paradise and he heard pleasant voices and a loud noise of talk and laughter captivating the senses of men so king sharrkan alighted and tying his steed to one of the trees went over a little way till he came upon a stream and heard a woman talking in arabic and saying now by the crush of the messiah this is not well of you but whose utters a word i will throw her and truss her up with her own girdle fn he kept walking in the direction of the sound and when he reached the further side he looked and behold a stream was gushing and flowing and antelopes at large were frisking and roving and wild cattle amid the pasture moving and birds expressed joy and gladness in their divers tongues and that place was purfled with all manner flowers and green herbs even as a poet described it in these couplets most beautiful is earth in budding bloom when lucid waters course through plain and wood no work but his th all great th all glorious giver of all gifts giver of all good and as sharrkan considered the place he saw in it a christian monastery within whose enceinte a castle towered high in air catching the light of the moon fn through the midst of the convent passed a stream the water flowing amongst its gardens and upon the bank sat the woman whose voice he had heard while before her stood ten handmaids like moons and wearing various sorts of raiment and ornaments that dazed and dazzled the beholder high bosomed virgins as saith of them the poet in these couplets the mead is bright with what is on t of merry maidens debonnair double its beauty and its grace those trooping damsels slender fair virgins of graceful swimming gait ready with eye and lip to ensnare and like the tendril d vine they loose the rich profusion of their hair shooting their shafts and arrows from beautiful eyes beyond compare overpowering and transpiercing every froward adversaire sharrkan gazed upon the ten girls and saw in their midst a lady like the moon at fullest with ringleted hair and forehead sheeny white and eyes wondrous wide and black and bright and temple locks like the scorpion s tail and she was perfect in essence and attributes as the poet said of her in these couplets she beamed on my sight with a wondrous glance and her straight slender stature enshamed the lance she burst on my sight with cheeks rosy red where all manner of beauties have habitance and the locks on her forehead were lowering as night whence issues a dawn tide of happiest chance then sharrkan heard her say to the handmaids come ye on that i may wrestle with you and gravel you ere the moon set and the dawn break so each came up to her in turn and she grounded them forthright and pinioned them with their girdles and ceased not wrestling and pitching them until she had overthrown one and all then there turned to her an old woman who was before her and the beldam said as in wrath o strumpet cost thou glory in grounding these girls behold i am an old woman yet have i thrown them forty times so what hast thou to boast of but if thou have the strength to wrestle with me stand up that i may grip thee and set thy head between thy heels the young lady smiled at her words but she was filled with inward wrath and she jumped up and asked o my lady zat al dawahi fn by the truth of the messiah wilt thou wrestle with me in very deed or dost thou jest with me and she answered yea and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say when it was the forty seventh night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the young lady asked zat al dawahi by the truth of the messiah wilt wrestle with me or dost jest and she answered yea i will wrestle with thee in very deed sharrkan looking on the while the damsel cried rise up for the fall an thou have spunk so to do when the old woman heard this she raged with exceeding rage and her body hair stood on end like the bristles of a fretful hedgehog fn then she sprang to her feet whilst the damsel stood up to her and said now by the truth of the messiah i will not wrestle with thee unless i be naked mistress whore fn so she loosed her petticoat trousers and putting her hand under her clothes tore them off her body then twisted up a silken kerchief into cord shape girt it round her middle and became as she were a scald head if ritah or a spotted snake with this she inclined towards the damsel and said do thou as i have done all this time sharrkan was gazing at the twain and laughing at the beldam s loathly semblance so the damsel leisurely rose and taking a sash of yamani stuff passed it twice round her waist then she tucked up her trousers and displayed two calves of alabaster carrying a mound of crystal smooth and rounded and a stomach which exhaled musk from its dimples as it were a bed of nu uman s anemones and breasts like double pomegranates then the old woman leant towards her and the two laid hold either of each while sharrkan raised his head heavenwards and prayed allah that the belle might beat the beldam presently the young woman get beneath the old woman and gripping her waist cloth with the left and circling her neck with the right hand hoisted her off the ground with both whereupon the old woman strove to free herself and in so doing fell on her back arsiversy with her legs high in air and her hairy bush between them showed manifest in the moonshine furthermore she let fly two great farts fn one of which blew up the dust from the earth s face and the other steamed up to the gate of heaven sharrkan laughed till he fell back upon the ground then he arose and baring his brand looked right and left but he saw no one save the old woman sprawling on her back and said to himself he lied not who named thee lady of calamities verily thou knewest her prowess by her performance upon the others so he drew near them to hear what should pass between them then the young lady went up to the old one and throwing a wrapper of thin silk upon her nakedness helped her to don her clothes and made excuses saying o my lady zat al dawahi i intended only to throw thee and not all this but thou triedst to twist out of my hands so laud to allah for safety she returned her no answer but rose in her shame and walked away till out of sight leaving the handmaids prostrate and pinioned with the fair damsel standing amongst them quoth sharrkan to himself every luck hath its cause sleep did not fall upon me nor the war horse bear me hither save for my good fortune for doubtless this maid and what is with her shall become booty to me so he made towards his steed and mounted and heeled fn him on when he sped as the shaft speeds from the bow and in his hand he still hent his brand bare of sheath which he brandished shouting the while his war cry allah is all mighty fn when the damsel saw him she sprang to her feet and taking firm stand on the bank of the stream whose breadth was six ells the normal cubits made one bound and landed clear on the farther side fn where she turned and cried out with a loud voice who art thou o thou fellow that breakest in upon our privacy and pastime and that too hanger in hand as if charging a host whence camest thou and whither art thou going speak sooth for truth will stand thee in good stead and lie not for lies come of villein breed doubtless thou hast wandered this night from thy way that thou chancedst upon this place whence escape were the greatest of mercies for thou art now in an open plain and did we shout but a single shout would come to our rescue four thousand knights fn so tell me what thou wantest and if thou wouldst only have us set thee on the right road we will do so when sharrkan heard her words he replied i am a stranger of the moslems who fared forth this night single handed seeking for spoil nor could this moonlight show me a fairer booty than these ten maidens so i shall seize them and rejoin my comrades with them quoth she i would have thee know that as for the booty thou hast not come at it and as for the handmaids by allah they shall never be thy spoil have i not told thee that to lie is villein vile quoth he the wise man is he who taketh warning by others thereupon quoth she by the truth of the messiah did i not fear that thy death would be on my hands i would shout a shout should fill the mead for thee with war steeds and with men of might but i take pity upon the stranger so if thou seek booty i require of thee that thou alight from thy steed and swear to me by thy faith that thou wilt not advance against me aught like arms in hand and we will wrestle i and thou if thou throw me set me on thy steed and take all of us to thy booty but if i throw thee thou shalt become under my command swear this to me for i fear thy treachery indeed it hath become a common saw where perfidy is innate there trust is a weakly mate now an thou wilt swear i will return and draw near to thee and tackle thee answered sharrkan and indeed he lusted to seize her and said in his soul truly she knoweth not that i am a champion of champions swear me by what oath thou wilt and by what thou deemest most binding and i will not approach thee with aught till thou hast made thy preparation and sayest draw near that i wrestle with thee if thou throw me i have money where withal to ransom myself and if i throw thee twill be booty and booty enough for me rejoined the damsel i am content herewith and sharrkan was astounded at her words and said and by the truth of the apostle whom allah bless and keep i too am content on the other part then said she swear to me by him who sprite in body dight and dealt laws to rule man kind aright that thou wilt not offer me aught of violence save by way of wrestling else mayst thou die without the pale of al islam sharrkan replied by allah were a kazi to swear me even though he were a kazi of the kazis fn he would not impose upon me such an oath as this then he sware to her by all she named and tied his steed to a tree but he was drowned in the sea of thought saying in himself praise be to him who fashioned her from dirty water fn then he girt himself and made ready for wrestling and said to her cross the stream to me but she replied it is not for me to come over to thee if thou wilt pass thou over here to me i cannot do that quoth he and quoth she o boy i will come across to thee so she tucked up her skirts and leaping landed on the other side of the stream by his side whereupon he drew near to her and bent him forwards and clapped palms fn but he was confounded by her beauty and loveliness for he saw a shape which the hand of power had tanned with the dye leaves of the jann which had been fostered by the hand of beneficence and fanned by the zephyrs of fair fortune and whose birth a propitious ascendant had greeted then she called out to him o moslem come on and let us wrestle ere the break of morning and tucked up her sleeves from a forearm like fresh curd which illumined the whole place with its whiteness and sharrkan was dazzled by it then he bent forwards and clapped his palms by way of challenge she doing the like and caught hold of her and the two grappled and gripped and interlocked hands and arms presently he shifted his hands to her slender waist when his finger tips sank into the soft folds of her middle breeding languishment and he fell a trembling like the persian reed in the roaring gale so she lifted him up and throwing him to the ground sat upon his breast with hips and hinder cheeks like mounds of sand for his soul had lost mastery over his senses then she asked him o moslem the slaying of nazarenes is lawful to you folk what then hast thou to say about being slain thyself and he answered o my lady thy speech as regards slaying me is not other than unlawful for our prophet mohammed whom allah bless and preserve prohibited the slaying of women and children old men and monks as it was thus revealed to your prophet she replied it behoveth us to render the equivalent of his mercy so rise i give thee thy life for generosity is never lost upon the generous then she got off his breast and he rose and stood shaking the dust from his head against the owners of the curved rib even women and she said to him be not ashamed but verily one who entereth the land of roum in quest of booty and cometh to assist kings against kings how happeneth it that he hath not strength enough to defend himself from one made out of the curved rib twas not for lack of strength in me he answered nor didst thou throw me by thy force it was thy loveliness overthrew me so if thou wilt grant me another bout it will be of thy courtesy she laughed and said i grant thee thy request but these handmaids have long been pinioned and their arms and sides are weary and it were only right i should loose them for haply this next wrestling bout will be long then she went to the slave girls and unbinding them said to them in the tongue of greece get ye to some safe place till i foil this moslem s lust and longing for you so they went away whilst sharrkan kept gazing at them and they kept turning to look at the two then each approached the adversary and he set his breast against hers but when he felt waist touch waist his strength failed him and she waxing ware of this lifted him with her hands swiftlier than the blinding leven flash and threw him to the ground he fell on his back fn and then she said to him rise i give thee thy life a second time i spared thee in the first count because of thy prophet for that he made unlawful the slaying of women and i do so on the second count because of thy weakliness and the greenness of thine years and thy strangerhood but i charge thee if there be in the moslem army sent by omar bin al nu uman to succour the king of constantinople a stronger than thou send him hither and tell him of me for in wrestling there are shifts and trips catches and holds such as the feint or falsing and the snap or first grip the hug the feet catch the thigh lite fn the jostle and the leg lock by allah o my lady quoth sharrkan and indeed he was highly incensed against her had i been master al safd master mohammed kim l or ibn al sadd fn as they were in their prime i had kept no note of these shifts thou mentionest for o my mistress by allah thou hast not grassed me by thy strength but by the blandishments of thy back parts for we men of mesopotamia so love a full formed thigh that nor sense was left me nor foresight but now an thou wish thou shalt try a third fall with me while my wits are about me and this last match is allowed me by the laws of the game which sayeth the best of three moreover i have regained my presence of mind when she heard his words she said to him hast thou not had a belly full of this wrestling o vanquished one however come on an thou wilt but know that this must be the last round then she bent forward and challenged him and sharrkan did likewise setting to it in real earnest and being right cautious about the throw so the two strove awhile and the damsel found in him a strength such as she had not observed before and said to him o moslem thou art now on thy mettle yes he replied thou knowest that there remaineth to me but this one round after which each of us will wend a different way she laughed and he laughed too fn then she overreached at his thigh and caught firm hold of it unawares which made him greet the ground and fall full on his back she laughed at him and said art thou an eater of bran thou are like a badawi s bonnet which falleth off with every touch or else the father of winds fn that droppeth before a puff of air fie upon thee o thou poor thing adding get thee back to the moslem army and send us ot,"['flow', 'nurse', 'trust', 'offspring', 'slave',

the universe does not look like a lot of bright little dots to the creatures from tralfamadore the creatures can see where each star has been and where it is going so that the heavens are filled with rarefied luminous spaghetti and tralfamadorians don t see human beings as two legged creatures either they see them as great millipedes with babies legs at one end and old people s legs at the other says billy pilgrim billy asked for something to read on the trip to tralfamadore his captors had five million earthling books on microfilm but no way to project them in billy s cabin they had only one actual book in english which would be placed in a tralfamadorian museum it was valley of the dolls by jacqueline susann billy read it thought it was pretty good in spots the people in it certainly had their ups and downs ups and downs but billy didn t want to read about the same ups and downs over and over again he asked if there wasn t please some other reading matters around only tralfamadorian novels which i m afraid you couldn t begin to understand said the speaker on the wall let me look at one anyway so they sent him in several they were little things a dozen of them might have had the bulk of valley of the dolls with all its ups and downs up and downs billy couldn t read tralfamadorian of course but he could at least see how the books were laid out in brief clumps of symbols separated by stars billy commented that the clumps might be telegrams exactly said the voice they are telegrams there are no telegrams on tralfamadore but you re right each clump of symbols is abrief urgent message describing a situation a scene we tralfamadorians read them all at once not one after the other there isn t any particular relationship between all the messages except that the author has chosen them carefully so that when seen all at once they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep there is no beginning no middle no end no suspense no moral no causes no effects what we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time moments after that the saucer entered a time warp and billy was flung back into his childhood he was twelve years old quaking as he stood with his mother and father on bright angel point at the rim of grand canyon the little human family was staring at the floor of the canyon one mile straight down well said billy s father manfully kicking a pebble into space there it is they had come to this famous place by automobile they had had several blowouts on the way it was worth the trip said billy s mother raptly oh god was it ever worth it billy hated the canyon he was sure that he was going to fall in his mother touched him and he wet his pants there were other tourists looking down into the canyon too and a ranger was there to answer questions a frenchman who had come all the way from france asked the ranger in broken english if many people committed suicide by jumping in yes sir said the ranger about three folks a year so it goes and billy took a very short trip through time made a peewee jump of only ten days so he was still twelve still touring the west with his family now they were down in carlsbad caverns and billy was praying to god to get him out of there before the ceiling fell in a ranger was explaining that the caverns had been discovered by a cowboy who saw a huge cloud of bats come out of a hole in the ground and then he said that he was going to turn out all the lights and that it would probably be the first time in the lives of most people there that they had ever been in darkness that was total out went the lights billy didn t even know whether he was still alive or not and then something ghostly floated in air to his left it had numbers on it his father had taken out his pocket watch the watch had a radium dial billy went from total dark to total light found himself back in the war back in the delousing station again the shower was over an unseen hand had turned the water off when billy got his clothes back they weren t any cleaner but all the little animals that had been living in them were dead so it goes and his new overcoat was thawed out and limp now it was much too small for billy it had a fur collar and a g of crimson silk and had apparently been made for an impresario about as big as an organ grinder s monkey it was full of bullet holes billy pilgrim dressed himself he put on the little overcoat too it split up the back and at the shoulders the sleeves came entirely free so the coat became a fur collared vest it was meant to flare at its owners waist but the flaring took place at billy s armpits the germans found him to be one of the most screamingly funny things they had seen in all of the second world war they laughed and laughed and the germans told everybody else to form in ranks of five with billy as their pivot then out of doors went the parade and through gate after gate again there were more starving russians with faces like radium dials the americans were livelier than before the jazzing with hot water had cheered them up and they came to a shed where a corporal with only one arm and one eye wrote the name and serial number of each prisoner in a big red ledger everybody was legally alive now before they got their names and numbers in that book they were missing in action and probably dead so it goes as the americans were waiting to move on an altercation broke out in their rear most rank an american had muttered something which a guard did not like the guard knew english and he hauled the american out of ranks knocked him down the american was astonished he stood up shakily spitting blood he d had two teeth knocked out he had meant no harm by what he d said evidently had no idea that the guard would hear and understand why me he asked the guard the guard shoved him back into ranks vy you vy anybody he said when billy pilgrim s name was inscribed in the ledger of the prison camp he was given a number too and an iron dogtag in which that number was stamped a slave laborer from poland had done the stamping he was dead now so it goes billy was told to hang the tag around his neck along with his american dogtags which he did the tag was like a salt cracker perforated down its middle so that a strong man could snap it in two with his bare hands in case billy died which he didn t half the tag would mark his body and half would mark his grave after poor edgar derby the high school teacher was shot in dresden later on a doctor pronounced him dead and snapped his dogtag in two so it goes properly enrolled and tagged the americans were led through gate after gate again in two days time now their families would learn from the international red cross that they were alive next to billy was little paul lazzaro who had promised to avenge roland weary lazzaro wasn t thinking about vengeance he was thinking about his terrible bellyache his stomach had shrunk to the size of a walnut that dry shriveled pouch was as sore as a boil next to lazzaro was poor doomed old edgar derby with his american and german dogs displayed like a necklace on the outside of his clothes he had expected to become a captain a company commander because of his wisdom and age now here he was on the czechoslovakian border at midnight halt said a guard the americans halted they stood there quietly in the cold the sheds they were among were outwardly like thousands of other sheds they had passed there was this difference though the sheds had tin chimneys and out of the chimneys whirled constellations of sparks a guard knocked on a door the door was flung open from inside light leaped out through the door escaped from prison at miles per second out marched fifty middle aged englishmen they were singing hail hail the gang s all here from the pirates of penzance these lusty ruddy vocalists were among the first english speaking prisoners to be taken in the second world war now they were singing to nearly the last they had not seen a woman or a child for four years or more they hadn t seen any birds either not even sparrows would come into the camp the englishmen were officers each of them had attempted to escape from another prison at least once now they were here dead center in a sea of dying russians they could tunnel all they pleased they would inevitably surface within a rectangle of barbed wire would find themselves greeted listlessly by dying russians who spoke no english who had no food or useful information or escape plans of their own they could scheme all they pleased to hide aboard a vehicle or steal one but no vehicle ever came into their compound they could feign illness if they liked but that wouldn t earn them a trip anywhere either the only hospital in the camp was a six bed affair in the british compound itself the englishmen were clean and enthusiastic and decent and strong they sang boomingly well they had been singing together every night for years the englishmen had also been lifting weights and chinning themselves for years their bellies were like washboards the muscles of their calves and upper arms were like cannonballs they were all masters of checkers and chess and bridge and cribbage and dominoes and anagrams and charades and ping pong and billiards as well they were among the wealthiest people in europe in terms of food a clerical error early in the war when food was still getting through to prisoners had caused the red cross to ship them five hundred parcels every month instead of fifty the englishmen had hoarded these so cunningly that now as the war was ending they had three tons of sugar one ton of coffee eleven hundred pounds of chocolate seven hundred pounds of tobacco seventeen hundred pounds of tea two tons of flour one ton of canned beef twelve hundred pounds of canned butter sixteen hundred pounds of canned cheese eight hundred pounds of powdered milk and two tons of orange marmalade they kept all this in a room without windows they had ratproofed it by lining it with flattened tin cans they were adored by the germans who thought they were exactly what the englishmen ought to be they made war look stylish and reasonable and fun so the germans let them have four sheds though one shed would have held them all and in exchange for coffee or chocolate or tobacco the germans gave them paint and lumber and nails and cloth for fixing things up the englishmen had known for twelve hours that american guests were on their way they had never had guests before and they went to work like darling elves sweeping mopping cooking baking making mattresses of straw and burlap bags setting tables putting party favors at each place now they were singing their welcome to their guests in the winter night their clothes were aromatic with the feast they had been preparing they were dressed half for battle half for tennis or croquet they were so elated by their own hospitality and by all the goodies waiting inside that they did not take a good look at their guests while they sang and they imagined that they were singing to fellow officers fresh from the fray they wrestled the americans toward the shed door affectionately filling the night with manly blather and brotherly rodomontades they called them yank told them good show promised them that jerry was on the run and so on billy pilgrim wondered dimly who jerry was now he was indoors next to an iron cookstove that was glowing cherry red dozens of teapots were boiling there some of them had whistles and there was a witches cauldron full of golden soup the soup was thick primeval bubbles surfaced it with lethargical majesty as billy pilgrim stared there were long tables set for a banquet at each place was a bowl made from a can that had once contained powdered milk a smaller can was a cup a taller more slender can was a tumbler each tumbler was filled with warm milk at each place was a safety razor a washcloth a package of razor blades a chocolate bar two cigars a bar of soap ten cigarettes a book of matches a pencil and a candle only the candles and the soap were of german origin they had a ghostly opalescent similarity the british had no way of knowing it but the candles and the soap were made from the fat of rendered jews and gypsies and fairies and communists and other enemies of the state so it goes the banquet hall was illuminated by candlelight there were heaps of fresh baked white bread on the tables gobs of butter pots of marmalade there were platters of sliced beef from cans soup and scrambled eggs and hot marmalade pie were yet to come and at the far end of the shed billy saw pink arches with azure draperies hanging between them and an enormous clock and two golden thrones and a bucket and a mop it was in this setting that the evening s entertainment would take place a musical version of cinderella the most popular story ever told billy pilgrim was on fire having stood too close to the glowing stove the hem of his little coat was burning it was a quiet patient sort of fire like the burning of punk billy wondered ff there was a telephone somewhere he wanted to call his mother to tell her he was alive and well there was silence now as the englishmen looked in astonishment at the frowsy creatures they had so lustily waltzed inside one of the englishmen saw that billy was on fire you re on fire lad he said and he got billy away from the stove and beat out the sparks with his hands when billy made no comment on this the englishman asked him can you talk can you hear billy nodded the englishman touched him exploratorily here and there filled with pity my god what have they done to you lad this isn t a man it s a broken kite are you really an american said the englishman yes said billy and your rank private what became of your boots lad i don t remember is that coat a joke sir where did you get such a thing billy had to think hard about that they gave it to me he said at last jerry gave it to you who the germans gave it to you yes billy didn t like the questions they were fatiguing ohhhh yank yank yank said the englishman that coat was an insult sir it was a deliberate attempt to humiliate you you mustn t let jerry do things like that billy pilgrim swooned billy came to on a chair facing the stage he had somehow eaten and now he was watching cinderella some part of him had evidently been enjoying the performance for quite a while billy was laughing hard the women in the play were really men of course the clock had just struck midnight and cinderella was lamenting goodness me the clock has struck alackaday and fuck my luck billy found the couplet so comical that he not only laughed he shrieked he went on shrieking until he was carried out of the shed and into another where the hospital was it was a six bed hospital there weren t any other patients in there billy was put to bed and tied down and given a shot of morphine another american volunteered to watch over him this volunteer was edgar derby the high school teacher who would be shot to death in dresden so it goes derby sat on a three legged stool he was given a book to read the book was the red badge of courage by stephen crane derby had read it before now he read it again while billy pilgrim entered a morphine paradise under morphine billy had a dream of giraffes in a garden the giraffes were following gravel paths were pausing to munch sugar pears from treetops billy was a giraffe too he ate a pear it was a hard one it fought back against his grinding teeth it snapped in juicy protest the giraffes accepted billy as one of their own as a harmless creature as preposterously specialized as themselves two approached him from opposite sides leaned against him they had long muscular upper lips which they could shape like the bells of bugles they kissed him with these they were female giraffes cream and lemon yellow they had horns like doorknobs the knobs were covered with velvet why night came to the garden of the giraffes and billy pilgrim slept without dreaming for a while and then he traveled in time he woke up with his head under a blanket in a ward for nonviolent mental patients in a veterans hospital near lake placid new york it was springtime in three years after the end of the war billy uncovered his head the windows of the ward were open birds were twittering outside poo tee weet one asked him the sun was high there were twenty nine other patients assigned to the ward but they were all outdoors now enjoying the day they were free to come and go as they pleased to go home even if they liked and so was billy pilgrim they had come here voluntarily alarmed by the outside world billy had committed himself in the middle of his final year at the ilium school of optometry nobody else suspected that he was going crazy everybody else thought he looked fine and was acting fine now he was in the hospital the doctors agreed he was going crazy they didn t think it had anything to do with the war they were sure billy was going to pieces because his father had thrown him into the deep end of the y m c a swimming pool when he was a little boy and had then taken him to the rim of the grand canyon the man assigned to the bed next to billy s was a former infantry captain named eliot rosewater rosewater was sick and tired of being drunk all the time it was rosewater who introduced billy to science fiction and in particular to the writings of kilgore trout rosewater had a tremendous collection of science fiction paperbacks under his bed he had brought them to the hospital in a steamer trunk those beloved frumpish books gave off a smell that permeated the ward like flannel pajamas that hadn t been changed for a month or like irish stew kilgore trout became billy s favorite living author and science fiction became the only sort of tales he could read rosewater was twice as smart as billy but he and billy were dealing with similar crises in similar ways they had both found life meaningless partly because of what they had seen in war rosewater for instance had shot a fourteen year old fireman mistaking him for a german soldier so it goes and billy had seen the greatest massacre in european history which was the firebombing of dresden so it goes so they were trying to re invent themselves and their universe science fiction was a big help rosewater said an interesting thing to billy one time about a book that wasn t science fiction he said that everything there was to know about life was in the brothers karamazov by feodor dostoevsky but that isn t enough any more said rosewater another time billy heard rosewater say to a psychiatrist i think you guys are going to have to come up with a lot of wonderful new lies or people just aren t going to want to go on living there was a still life on billy s bedside table two pills an ashtray with three lipstick stained cigarettes in it one cigarette still burning and a glass of water the water was dead so it goes air was trying to get out of that dead water bubbles were clinging to the walls of the glass too weak to climb out the cigarettes belonged to billy s chain smoking mother she had sought the ladies room which was off the ward for wacs and waves and spars and wafs who had gone bananas she would be back at any moment now billy covered his head with his blanket again he always covered his head when his mother came to see him in the mental ward always got much sicker until she went away it wasn t that she was ugly or had bad breath or a bad personality she was a perfectly nice standard issue brown haired white woman with a high school education she upset billy simply by being his mother she made him feel embarrassed and ungrateful and weak because she had gone to so much trouble to give him life and to keep that life going and billy didn t really like life at all billy heard eliot rosewater come in and lie down rosewater s bedsprings talked a lot about that rosewater was a big man but not very powerful he looked as though he might be made out of nose putty and then billy s mother came back from the ladies room sat down on a chair between billy s and rosewater s bed rosewater greeted her with melodious warmth asked how she was today he seemed delighted to hear that she was fine he was experimenting with being ardently sympathetic with everybody he met he thought that might make the world a slightly more pleasant place to live in he called billy s mother dear he was experimenting with calling everybody dear some day she promised rosewater i m going to come in here and billy is going to uncover his head and do you know what he s going to say what s he going to say dear he s going to say hello mom and he s going to smile he s going to say gee it s good to see you mom how have you been today could be the day every night i pray that s a good thing to do people would be surprised if they knew how much in this world was due to prayers you never said a truer word dear does your mother come to see you often my mother is dead said rosewater so it goes i m sorry at least she had a happy life as long as it lasted that s a consolation anyway yes billy s father is dead you know said billy s mother so it goes a boy needs a father and on and on it went that duet between the dumb praying lady and the big hollow man so full of loving echoes he was at the top of his class when this happened said billy s mother maybe he was working too hard said rosewater he held a book he wanted to read but he was much too polite to read and talk too easy as it was to give billy s mother satisfactory answers the book was maniacs in the fourth dimension by kilgore trout it was about people whose mental diseases couldn t be treated because the causes of the diseases were all in the fourth dimension and three dimensional earthling doctors couldn t see those causes at all or even imagine them one thing trout said that rosewater liked very much was that there really were vampires and werewolves and goblins and angels and so on but that they were in the fourth dimension so was william blake rosewater s favorite poet according to trout so were heaven and hell he s engaged to a very rich girl said billy s mother that s good said rosewater money can be a great comfort sometimes it really can of course it can it isn t much fun if you have to pinch every penny till it screams it s nice to have a little breathing room her father owns the optometry school where billy was going he also owns six offices around our part of the state he flies his own plane and has a summer place up on lake george that s a beautiful lake billy fell asleep under his blanket when he woke up again he was tied to the bed in the hospital back in prison he opened one eye saw poor old edgar derby reading the red badge of courage by candlelight billy closed that one eye saw in his memory of the future poor old edgar derby in front of a firing squad in the ruins of dresden there were only four men in that squad billy had heard that one man in each firing squad was customarily given a rifle loaded with blank cartridge billy didn t think there would be a blank cartridge issued in a squad that small in a war that old now the head englishman came into the hospital to check on billy he was an infantry colonel captured at dunkirk it was he who had given billy morphine there wasn t a real doctor in the compound so the doctoring was up to him how s the patient he asked derby dead to the world but not actually dead no how nice to feel nothing and still get full credit for being alive derby now came to lugubrious attention no no please as you were with only two men for each officer and all the men sick i think we can do without the usual pageantry between officers and men derby remained standing you seem older than the rest said the colonel derby told him he was forty five which was two years older than the colonel the colonel said that the other americans had all shaved now that billy and derby were the only two still with beards and he said you know we ve had to imagine the war here and we have imagined that it was being fought by aging men like ourselves we had forgotten that wars were fought by babies when i saw those freshly shaved faces it was a shock my god my god i said to myself it s the children s crusade the colonel asked old derby how he had been captured and derby told a tale of being in a clump of trees with about a hundred other frightened soldiers the battle had been going on for five days the hundred had been driven into the trees by tanks derby described the incredible artificial weather that earthlings sometimes create for other earthlings when they don t want those other earthlings to inhabit earth any more shells were bursting in the treetops with terrific bangs he said showering down knives and needles and razorblades little lumps of lead in copper jackets were crisscrossing the woods under the shellbursts zipping along much faster than sound a lot of people were being wounded or killed so it goes then the shelling stopped and a hidden german with a loudspeaker told the americans to put their weapons down and come out of the woods with their hands on the top of their heads or the shelling would start again it wouldn t stop until everybody in there was dead so the americans put their weapons down and they came out of the woods with their hands on top of their heads because they wanted to go on living if they possibly could billy traveled in time back to the veterans hospital again the blanket was over his head it was quiet outside the blanket is my mother gone said billy yes billy peeked out from under his blanket his fianc e was out there now sitting on the visitor s chair her name was valencia merble valencia was the daughter of the owner of the ilium school of optometry she was rich she was as big as a house because she couldn t stop eating she was eating now she was eating a three musketeers candy bar she was wearing trifocal lenses in harlequin frames and the frames were trimmed with rhinestones the glitter of the rhinestones was answered by the glitter of the diamond in her engagement ring the diamond was insured for eighteen hundred dollars billy had found that diamond in germany it was booty of war billy didn t want to marry ugly valencia she was one of the symptoms of his disease he knew he was going crazy when he heard himself proposing marriage to her when he begged her to take the diamond ring and be his companion for life billy said hello to her and she asked him if he wanted some candy and he said no thanks she asked him how he was and he said much better thanks she said that everybody at the optometry school was sorry he was sick and hoped he would be well soon and billy said when you see em tell em hello she promised she would she asked him if there was anything she could bring him from the outside and he said no i have just about everything i want what about books said valencia i m right next to one of the biggest private libraries in the world said billy meaning eliot rosewater s collection of science fiction rosewater was on the next bed reading and billy drew him into the conversation asked him what he was reading this time so rosewater told him it was the gospel from outer space by kilgore trout it was about a visitor from outer space shaped very much like a tralfamadorian by the way the visitor from outer space made a serious study of christianity to learn if he could why christians found it so easy to be cruel he concluded that at least part of the trouble was slipshod storytelling in the new testament he supposed that the intent of the gospels was to teach people among other things to be merciful even to the lowest of the low but the gospels actually taught this before you kill somebody make absolutely sure he isn t well connected so it goes the flaw in the christ stories said the visitor from outer space was that christ who didn t look like much was actually the son of the most powerful being in the universe readers understood that so when they came to the crucifixion they naturally thought and rosewater read out loud again oh boy they sure picked the wrong guy to lynch that time and that thought had a brother there are right people to lynch who people not well connected so it goes the visitor from outer space made a gift to earth of a new gospel in it jesus really was a nobody and a pain in the neck to a lot of people with better connections than he had he still got to say all the lovely and puzzling things he said in the other gospels so the people amused themselves one day by nailing him to a cross and planting the cross in the ground there couldn t possibly be any repercussions the lynchers thought the reader would have to think that too since the new gospel hammered home again and again what a nobody jesus was and then just before the nobody died the heavens opened up and there was thunder and lightning the voice of god came crashing down he told the people that he was adopting the bum as his son giving him the full powers and privileges of the son of the creator of the universe throughout all eternity god said this from this moment on he will punish horribly anybody who torments a bum who has no connections billy s fianc e had finished her three musketeers candy bar now she was eating a milky way forget books said rosewater throwing that particular book under his bed the hell with em that sounded like an interesting one said valencia jesus if kilgore trout could only write rosewater exclaimed he had a point kilgore trout s unpopularity was deserved his prose was frightful only his ideas were good i don t think trout has ever been out of the country rosewater went on my god he writes about earthlings all the time and they re all americans practically nobody on earth is an american where does he live valencia asked nobody knows rosewater replied i m the only person who ever heard of him as far as i can tell no two books have the same publisher and every time i write him in care of a publisher the letter comes back because the publisher has failed he changed the subject now congratulated valencia on her engagement ring thank you she said and held it out so rosewater could get a close look billy got that diamond in the war that s the attractive thing about war said rosewater absolutely everybody gets a little something with regard to the whereabouts of kilgore trout he actually lived in ilium billy s hometown friendless and despised billy would meet him by and by billy said valencia merble hm you want to talk about our silver pattern sure i ve got it narrowed down pretty much to either royal danish or rambler rose rambler rose said billy it isn t something we should rush into she said i mean whatever we decide on that s what we re going to have to live with the rest of our lives billy studied the pictures royal danish he said at last colonial moonlight is nice too yes it is said billy pilgrim and billy traveled in time to the zoo on tralfamadore he was forty four years old on display under a geodesic dome he was reclining on the lounge chair which had been his cradle during his trip through space he was naked the tralfamadorians were interested in his body all of it there were thousands of them outside holding up their little hands so that their eyes could see him billy had been on tralfamadore for six earthling months now he was used to the crowd escape was out of the question the atmosphere outside the dome was cyanide and earth was miles away billy was displayed there in the zoo in a simulated earthling habitat most of the furnishings had been stolen from the sears roebuck warehouse in iowa city iowa there was a color television set and a couch that could be converted into a bed there were end tables with lamps and ashtrays on them by the couch there was a home bar and two stools there was a little pool table there was wall to wall carpeting in federal gold except in the kitchen and bathroom areas and over the iron manhole cover in the center of the floor there were magazines arranged in a fan on the coffee table in front of the couch there was a stereophonic phonograph the phonograph worked the television didn t there was a picture of one cowboy shooting another one pasted to the television tube so it goes there were no wall in the dome nor place for billy to hide the mint green bathroom fixtures were right out in the open billy got off his lounge chair now went into the bathroom and took a leak the crowd went wild billy brushed his teeth on tralfamadore put in his partial denture and went into his kitchen his bottled gas range and his refrigerator and his dishwasher were mint green too there was a picture painted on the door of the refrigerator the,"['burlap', 'dog', 'asleep', 'slave',

little fucking pussy i m in front of dna wow no fucking way this gotta be my lucky day i m about to tie him to a leash in case he tries to fuckin run away yeah the problem with you kids is that you lack respect but fuck me over on money right now and try to run out and i ma snap your neck cause people know that backing out of battles is not part of my plans but you and cortez always lie so not to my surprise all your alibis came as a bunch of unauthorized scams shit even if i met you in the middle of the east you d find a way to say that i ran but i m from los angeles i m proud to say that that s my land in l a we support our home teams we got a lot of pride but goddamn the way you ducked me in l a proves you ll always be more of a fan of the dodgers than i am you soft as hell i m not gonna lie fam in your battle with rex you almost copped a right hand from dot mobb s hopping hypeman when rex made fun of your retarded mother i know you wanted to fight man but then they called the cameras off and you walked off and called it a night damn sort of like when eminem told you lose yourself in the moment you only get one shot in a life span and you answered him like i know slim that s exactly why i m gonna walk away from this mic stand your boy cortez act on some g shit we were supposed to battle here he backed out like i need more cash now and that is some weak shit he s a sneaky latino so i wasn t surprised when i came to find out that he skipped he was already flaking like a tortilla so soon as i saw the guacamole on the side with the green chips i knew it was only right that that bean dipped it don t matter what battling league you actually be with if you gon be dumb enough to bite the hand that you eat with at least be smart enough to cover up your tracks and don t leave prints someone call up smack and tell him to cancel the field trip straps with the beams equipped like an active marine ready to damage your queenship shells battering the cannon ring until half of your team is seasick the other half starts abandoning ship panic and leap quick in the same fashion that hollow took his first chance to get green quick turned his back on gt packed up his bags took the cash and then he split and the faggot hasn t been seen since it s all a story that correlates if you go back and you read script i use this all as a scenario to reference the battling scene with cause grindtime is the ship and this is bad as the titanic sea gets cause without smack you wouldn t be shit but lost talent stranded across the atlantic sea without a raft to compete with i got the long nose like x factor i ll make the back of your jeep flip i said you d think we were playing xbox together the way i left half of your screen split my guns are barely legal with magazines that ll make this teen strip that s how you like it right come back with a clean flip yeah i m ready for the drama ain t no question marks i ll rip your flesh apart like jeffrey dahmer let s get it poppin i ll take the beef and steady chop it like a chef from benihana speaking of chefs shouts out to cortez s mama cause i heard every grandtime east coast event she be fixing poison pen his empanadas speaking of him you d have to pick up the phone and pen will call ya cause you too busy slumped over in the bed with hoffa holding hands with hollow we all know you were raised by dutch vega and sara kana what s the beef between us it s been a never ending saga i ll leave you walking around with bender s suppressed persona when i sketch menace your necklace off ya deadly waters i ll throw your body on the stretcher and let the chopper off boom boom boom boom boom bah boom bah and drop your paramedic helicopter i do this for my fans you mothafuckas ain t shit to me are y all kidding me i m fuckin bum rushin the enemy these knuckles will leave you bucklin instantly i ll fucking get men to start punching you viciously uppercuts will leave your stomach in misery like muscular dystrophy that s for thinking you can come online publicly dissing me you can pop your fists while i m still crushin you physically this shit is child s play you get ate side ways like the number infinity i said you need artist development before you come on the blog and then mention me i ll stomp you out and make you a part of this history don t show me that cause this is about to be the bodybag of the century hold on hold on you mothafuckas ain t shit to me they say karma s a bitch for you it s probably dentistry because the part of your mouth that s missing is only a reflection of what s scarring you mentally so the gap between your teeth exists merely as an object of imagery to distract you from the real gap between us and that s bars and delivery round dna november th it s ironic you know my father died on this day and i can still remember him telling me son say what you mean and mean what you say see i m only diz so in my past battles my emotions might have got carried away that s why i flew here to canada to make sure that won t happen today so when i grip the rip your spine make your body rewind man i don t mean that shit i ll probably never clap the shit out you but trust i mean every word when i say i ll smack the shit out you the difference between entertainment and real life like remember when i said i ll fuck you up in vegas well dependin on how this battle goes i still might cause see i still might move back move back what are you doing gettin in my face tryin to go crazy tryin to fuck me up when it s dead time when drake s here in front of the battle but you ain t gon make none of his headlines what i was tryin to say was that the difference between entertainment and real life like remember when i said i d fuck you up in vegas well dependin on how this battle goes i still might cause me missin a tooth only means i ve been in a real fight and got real stripes so until you get tapped with a sucker punch and missing yours from an uppercut then you know what this feels like i took this battle for youtube views promotion and fanbase so i made sure i m well prepared knowing my name would be buzzin in sweden china switzerland making them well aware so once i get rid of this storm and y all see the weather clear just think about the end of every other natural disaster you gone see dna everywhere remember against a class when y all was supposed to go seconds then on the day of the battle this guy switched it then remember against swave you had timed rounds but he said fuck it and you wound up rhymin for minutes then against me this guy told lush i m rhymin till i m finished which only proves further you got a problem with time limits see you the snake that s tryin to hide your rattle which only shows the canadian quarter ain t the only bitch that flips when it s time to battle and that s when i realized hmm you really got a problem with time like when you say you re a terrorist and a hijacker i m not gettin it cause if you detonate a bomb what you gon set the time to unlimited you really got a problem with time i discovered something diz while i was watchin your battles and nigga you have never wore a watch in your battles you really have a problem with time it s not opinion no more it s a fact nigga you do twelve lunchbreaks change times whenever you want with your hat to the back what the fuck you think you now black nigga y all all know we really got a problem with time but fuck that for the last two years you ve been givin me the runaround i managed to stay relevant with every battle reaching over thou you done the same but your music s trash so the industry will never love your style which makes you a earthquake cause you always gone be a disaster that remains underground see you just an entertainer diz in other words a fuckin gimmick and it s for so long that the delivery can mask those fuckin lyrics your rhymes are put together sloppy and unorganized that s why besides grindtime we ain t fuckin with it so battlin dna will be the first time his verses have structure in it so when you spit all aggressive with conviction i be thinkin that you actually mad and then understand why you hate us new york niggas cause he drive us around all the time in taxi cabs like his rap battle d he s supposed to be the big bad dizaster and when i see dna i ma shoot him and let the th clap ya i said dizaster let s fight he said cool i ma bitch slap ya soon as he hopped out the cab all you hear on the radio is dizaster it s your dispatcher please go pick up plex rock and lush one and stay away from dna you know you don t bust guns you never touched drugs a day in your life or touched none and hurry up your mom s calling rents due you must come so when you squint your fuckin eyebrows and spit with alllll that aggression i almost think you might really bust your glock but then again we saw him against arsonal and you ain t look too good with that fuckin shot you gon try to rebuttal everything i say don t act like you fuckin not but it s cool cause a good rebuttal only means i had to say somethin hot so don t be confused when he rebuttal every lyric i say and think he s clever with frees cause every time y all cheer for that great rebuttal you only givin credit to me you might also like round dizaster man dna you are so fucking hood i m gonna rebuttal everything you say goddamn it i didn t even know i was that good shit but fuck it since he wants to talk about time then we ll talk about time when i roll up outside and hurt ya but you re dna you never click clack the burner you never commit the murder see i do what i want with the time limits i ll just extend them further this world s mine i control time that s why they call me the prince of persia but you wanna rebuttal too i mean you rebuttal d your missing tooth but that s not even a rebuttal topic i mean you wanna rebuttal a missing tooth then make a cd put out some music get some money off it wait til at least you have one deposit go to your fucking dentist office write him a cheque with a fucking number on it and if it makes you feel any better about the situation you can write the word rebuttal on it homie listen it s been since day one i ain t liking you dude we can go outside right now and i m fighting you too it ain t about punchlines dna i ll just display how i m a better writer than you so stop talkin pay homage i m spittin i solve problems i m an awesome magician this street magic i ll make your beef vanish like hot pockets cause all of you chicken i wanna squab with him but if your squad is honestly trippin that car stoppin that glock poppin your top open like top ramen before you spark the ignition i start boxin bernard hopkins your heart stoppin chris farley condition there s no where to runin an arm bar caught in submisison now you lost in the mix got a bunch of hostages with him he tried hoppin the fence it s an impossible mission i m camouflaged in the trenches ready to penetrate your army s defences with these binocular lenses i have a prophet s vision is that the hardest kid in your clique i got a problem with it cause i m the motherfucker i m what your role model isn t i m the armed technician here to remodel your kitchen with a bomb in it the islamic edition part of your crib gone with the wind shards of you missin carvin your rib disarm the opposition then plant the pipe bomb in the car engine and have queen latifah set it off from the distance my job description i split wigs like a salon beautician that is special like your mom s condition i know y all have a problem with the retard jokes but i only use them cause he has something in common with them cause when he says he s flippin to mingle and he s letting the machete spray it s not hard for us to see the retarded in him i don t give a fuck if y all wanna donate to autism the truth is cover your ears bishop the truth is your mom s not even a good example of what being handicapped s about cause she s a master at that wheelchair in that i wouldn t have a doubt most people getting around when they re disabled they find it hard and you live in a massive house but she uses the fucking hallways as interstate freeways where she gets off at the nearest living room exit so she can take the fastest route weaving in and out of furniture traffic she doesn t even scratch the couch but she s kinda like you in a sense cause whenever she s stuck in a corner she s really good at backing out stop touching me y all gon make a rapping discovery i don t even know how i can battle you so comfortably i still can t even believe this faggot s in front of me everyday i wake up and i hit a blunt before i even wash my face up then i think about your genetic make up and how we can make up such a fake fuck you pussy you duck hunt you re getting duct taped up i ll kill every faggot in your city i ll even fuck mase up there s nowhere to run now you re on a one way truck about to get ran the fuck over over by a fucking one way truck you little fucking pussy your face is vaginal your mouth is like a vagina and in the center it has a hole but fuck a camel though you have enamel toe it s dizaster you know i act like a crude jerk your attitude is past faggot dude you got a gap in your tooth gagged and you yakked on your new shirt in your battle with tsu surf i react i m rollin fast i let the tool burst kids will get hit in ass like the back of a vatican school church i take stacks off packages this faggot don t move work the only cleaning his gap out is the only time he digs up or actually do dirt two thirds of his life has been a root canal conceited influenced you in style everything you about to do he happened to do first your foundation is missing like the roof of your mouth that is what you worth i would slap this dude around but the fact is life is already battling you worse and that is reality i know it s sad but the tooth hurts round dna diz you ain t say one thing hot you still ain t say the fuckin truth i ve been in about battles and he still gone mention my fuckin tooth and y all gone cheer cause you think it s nice people but that s wack cause its shit likes to go to the gap like white people so why you gon keep freestylin actin like you gettin it diz you ain t rippin it even your hat knows i m gonna win cause it s like cleveland you gone lose in the end then you wanted to mention my mom being disabled that s why i hate that you rap b you just placed in your rap d my teeth is missing and i got a face full of acne when that steel flare i bet all of these fans will cheer like drake in degrassi people are rappin you must be kiddin me i ll do you like pun have you dead in the middle of little italy thinkin you can spit with me you ain t hot as humidity so why would y all give him props for mention my mom with a disability i ll go to your mom s house come through smack her hard come through see her right quick then i snatch that broad catch her right in the kitchen while she s eatin caviar and put that bitch in a wheelchair out the blue like the avatar and this the point see somethin somethin you think that you so nice you little old clown you rebuttal half lines i damn near just rebuttal your whole round this the point where i pin you down and have organik hold you beat the shit outta you like your pops did when he disowned you give you the same treatment that you did every time you was disloyal but wait before i do all that i ma expose you remember what you told organik about king of the dot your league is fucking shitty bro if you ain t gonna give us the help in promotion and gettin dough then why the fuck you attach our logos against your bitch ass videos fuck king of the dot we technically invented you grindtime s the prototype we do what you pretend to do i will never respect this chump now you over here two years later i guess time flies loud cause if you ain t notice king of the dot is shittin on grind time now and your last three battles been in canada so this league basically made you bitch and you disrespected them in a battle you ungrateful bitch you a faggot i m just tryna figure out what made you switch i guess grind time held you down and then raped you bitch i couldn t wait to get in your face to tell you i hate you bitch flew all the way canada to put you in a wheelchair drake you bitch they said dna fell off well now i m back thank you bitch but how s his pop rich and you say you struggle dummy you take battles for free but gotta pay bills i guess you don t care about no fuckin money for a couple of pennies he ll be ready to travel so it makes sense when you ate that sandwich versus smp cause that s the only time you had bread in a battle then you disrespected jin and his whole race but i bet you if you seen him you d probably switch sides and dick ride and be pole dancin you whine and cry about every battle i bet you have a fit that you don t get your way at your folks mansion so it makes sense why you hate asians cause you always throw tantrums and everybody knows that battle versus locksmith that one counted cause you showed you hated asians more cause when you choked you looked dumbfounded but if that s too low then turn the volume on your speakers up your rhymes is weak as fuck like the last time redman and method man tried teamin up and when he said that line versus swave at first i was like woooh damn that s hot until method man co signed you and you just disrespected a legend who gave you props and then if you talkin like that then of course he s frontin there ain t a course i get him off for nothin this battle s six days after halloween it s ironic cause he already lost to pumpkin and he said in the mc book when you fuck up you keep goin and in the eyebrow book you keep shavin if they keep growin cause i ma keep it a hundred my tooth s missin and them eyebrows is real bushy so king of the dot let s keep it a hundred one of us is lyin sayin we get pussy when i run up on dizaster in new york with a knick s hoodie he ll back down and get scared and get mushy okay i lied i see one of us does get pussy but why do you keep on talkin when you act like you know you off the heat me right now nigga please i m off the beat i ll take your body off the concrete and throw it off the street you got that dog chain on right now but i m the one that s off the leash so why you keep rappin like you be rappin when it s dope you a faggot i ll clap it then jack it like your coat you told swave you pop the show him like columbine you think that you blood stop it five they brought this yellow tape here cause organik knew it was a homicide so don t act like your raps is hot or you ll blast the glock time s about to run out you can have your knot you have a problem with time so you don t know how to stop on time when your raps is hot but this caliente will make you die before the aftershock round dizaster you dissed me about the canada shit tryin to snatch my props i think it s funny how you have to mention caliente and aftershock so you can ride king of the dot s cock that s how you fuckin get around homie i ll stomp you the only reason you mentioned drake in degrassi because he reminds you of your mom too i m basically nasty there s a couple of questions my fans have been waiting to ask me does she really look like drake from degrassi is cortez really on the sideline raking the grass leaves you fucking you wanna get paid more guap now you wanna get paid like an athlete but you re on lockout cause you stay in a rap league that only caters to math s needs when you left your grindtime family you disappointed them you made them regret the fact they ever let you join with them no one forced you off the boat bitch it was your choice to swim now the only thing you ll ever ever have in common with poison pen is the fact that you ll never be boys again you know what else rhymes with poison pen umm i don t know backstabbing disloyal friend when you say bars over jokes why you gon pretend you don t truly believe bars are better than jokes you re not keeping it a hundred and ten cause you switch it up to comedy too i always hear laughter when your punches come to an end especially when you spit your gun bars we all think you re the funniest then i mean come on dawg you really can t fuckin rap with me i can go off the fuckin top and this whole thing will become a tragedy yeah motherfucker you ain t wanna be the man right now you fuckin can t even see me you can t even stand right now but i take care of my shit and i can fuckin kill you all yeah you little fuckin pussy i don t feel you all but since i ma change up on this topic cause i ma kill it tonight i ma touch up on a topic about why you lie and everybody s gonna feel it a ight this is a topic i wasn t gonna illustrate tonight i think most of the time your brains wouldn t be able to comply but i figured y all smarter generation are educated and figured i wouldn t be afraid to try see mainstream science is a bunch of manipulation in disguise they blindfold you from the real truth to distract you from a database they hide charles darwin is a faggot who thinks we came from evolution and later on we changed in size in a different phase in time what i m tryin to say to you is why would you believe in that and the bible those are all fairy tales goodbye cause the truth of our genetics is written in the ancient scribe our bloodline was given to us from aliens that came from spaceships in the sky now you re wondering why i m saying this it s cause based on his name i can relate it to this guy it s all reality based all in this equation still applies cause based on reality everything ever said that was about dna has been a lie i m embarrassin y all lames i m evisceratin your jaw and i m tearin your small frame rippin your fuckin heart out and leavin it there in the car lane you st st stuttered when you tried to mention that dog chain you stupid fuck you have terrible blog game yeah motherfucker the true stories you re supposedly telling they re lies and they re basically all lame dna hears a story one way when it comes out of his mouth it apparently got changed so you re not dna they gave you the wrong name you should change your name into the american arcane dna yo i m dna hold on hold on now i ma roll up and i ma come with the s and the and the s now when i go from and t hat ll mean you get hit with that s what you sound like a b c d e f g it s always the same thing if i bodied rone and rone bodied okwerdz then what does that make me shut the fuck up alright you re just an undercard to the main star actors what you gonna do now that smack don t wanna pay off none of these maincard rappers what you gonna do now huh do like you did in oun p and spit your little gay bars backwards what you gonna do race me in a race track in a race car backwards what you gonna do come with the metal after you summon the devil from listening to a lil wayne song backwards what you gonna do you wanna play that stupid little fuckin game then game on faggot i ll leave your little brain all trapped inside one of your own little gay bar patterns like go ahead dna flip the word radar backwards hold on hold on i can do it hold on so when i roll up with the ar and i spray off clappers that ll be the result of this battle if you spell the word radar backwards wait a minute radar that s still the same bar backwards hold on hold on now when i roll up with the and i spray off clappers that ll be the result of this battle if you spell the word radar backwards goddamn it it s still radar backwards truth is i ll break it down for y all since your boy cortez a k a jos won t explain this stuff i was on the cell all day tryin to set up this whole thang with lush while you in the background with him doing roleplay on the phone hangin up you think playin with my money is funny i ll blow this location up and i won t leave until i make sure your face gets crushed add more flame i turn your torso and face to dust more flame the propane take your soul raise it up i ll leave you fuckin clothes in your skull breakin up and dislocatin your shoulder bone from your rotator cuff you smile like you don t use colgate enough every couple of seconds when you re rappin your nose face gets touched like your tryin to point the way your cocaine is stuck or your just another faggot actor who thinks he s soulmates with lux but lux is the man syke you re both gay as fuck i ll rip hollow s hand off while it s still attached to his foam paper cup it was like six in the morning i saw you and your little sister jennifer cortez sit on the corner holdin up a sign that said for food we re willing to sit on a boner polish a ball sack and suck dick for a quarter and underneath it said please all we had for dinner was yoghurt your little smack gimmick image here literally won t work i bet math used to punk you and make you finish his homework this kid is like conceited except he ended up hitting his growth spurt your boy murder ave doesn t even exist it s not even a known turf you guys are both nomads the only home this ho has is literally his own shirt look at you rubbin yourself tryin to keep your composure you ran away fuckin smack because the events they had were bigger and doper always bitchin that grind time couldn t give you exposure so you walked around for like six months with a chip on your shoulder before you decided to jump ship hoping to get you a little bit closer but swiffed out on our interest cause you were the diva that was tippin it over and the sad part is all smack had to do to bribe you was promise to put some rims on your stroller they offered cortez a new fisherman boat so he doesn t have to swim to the border and hollow da don got a brand new nintendo controller people always said your boy cortez looked like pitbull and even though he s the same identical poser now i believe he s a pitbull since i seen him switch up on his owners listen here bitch you have a listening disorder your mission is officially over if you think you gon beat me i d rather hire jin as my chauffeur yeah i m a f engine versus a corolla and you re missin your motor i ll run up in your crib with them soldiers while you re sippin a soda catch you slippin put you in submission and fold ya then jump up and put my kicks on your sofa like tom cruise did to oprah yeah what s going on pussy it looks like that type of shit you cannot respond to you said on the track seconds on your song about your dad gone that you never clapped a revolver yeah remember one minute seconds you looked up to the light and screamed out i ve never touched a drug or busted a gun in my life you never clapped a revolver i ll flat line you snipe at your heart like the final boss you battle in contra so act like manic so act like manic i ll pop ya give me that deadly stare i ll let it air leaving shells everywhere like italian pasta you roll with a pack of imposters you don t wanna scrap i ll pull a mac and i ll sock ya get bitch slapped with the impact of a class crashin his honda i ll strike you faster than the black african mamba and send your body bag back to rwanda battling me is worse off than sharing a bath tub with blanka or getting a back rub massage from mortal kombat s baraka your breath smells like asshole and cacka you need to grab some binaca i ll backhand you and i will damage your chakra the day you beat me is the day everyone in canada considers sno an actual rasta what you know about weed your whole life you probably only seen two bags of ganja i m a youtube superstar everyday i have new fans from deutchland to jakarta from buktan to combala dominican republic and yucads in cabanas kuala lumpur and sri lanka down to sudan and uganda but all you have is two fans you re kitana i saw you wearing earrings that one day fake ass shits put on probably put on start wearing prada instead of fucking worrying about what you wear you should try and display some honour you scared to come to california afraid i ll put them grapes gangstas on ya but every time you rap it s about how you bang your llamas and how you give my brain caps and you be making trauma and how your homies rolled around vegas and shut the whole baby down and start creating drama but that doesn t make you crazy that makes you like qp s baby mama you never shot a gun in your life like you said yeah and that s the reason why i m having major problems with the way you were brought up but it ain t your fault that s why i blame madonna come on dawg let s kick some facts and just be honest huh you went to smack put up a stack and you peed on it and that is a fact i ain t gotta actually speak on it far as your facebook statuses the average is three comments you leave today with a stash in your jeans pocket then i m smackin that green off it you went to smack got jacked for your bread and didn t demolish you re average at best and to add to that threat this mc s polished fuck what this faggot just said i rapidly clap with that lead and rip a patch up the back of your head like rasheed wallace your mom s fucking retarded i mean it but it s not the same cause she s also a genius she gives a lot of brain she s a quadriplegic i don t give a fuck about her eating problems she can exercise some different feeding options she can t use her hands they shake so if she wants to have some steak she puts the knife between her toes and uses her retarded feet to chop them but no matter how good she gets at holding the silverware she always seems to drop them and then stands back looking at em like if only i had longer reach like dhalsim but i don t want no beef your mom s a g from compton any moment she might show up at king of the dot and get them heaters poppin so i better flee before she acts like stephen and brings the hawk in you rapped about your dad in the beginning that s some shit i wasn t gonna say but i m an evil motherfucker so all that shit you were talking about i think that shit is gay yeah i will fly him out of his casket and i ll slump the faggot i ll fuck your mom in front of her and i ll soak the mattress then i ll throw the broken prophylactic on his open casket i will forge a stack of boarding passes get on board a concorde and crash it into an overpass during morning traffic who said that come on admit it homie speak up brother i ll go back there right now and i ll fuck your mother callin fuckin organik like he fuckin owes you somethin motherfucker doesn t owe you nothin cause you don t know nothin about strugglin look at the saurus and illmac yeah look at the saurus cousin they re battling for pride if they lose today they re going home with nothin but you re too much of a pussy a battle you won t go judgin you d rather be a fuckin homo and just vote on public yo who the fuck is talking bro yo who s talking a ight i see you re offended because his mom is being brought up okay that shit is some harsh stuff but this is battling what do you expect this is the type of shit that pops up what what y all fuckin mad his mom is brought up i don t give a fuck if they have special needs they got all types of foundations to get their guap up i don t know about y all but i ve already donated enough money from my heart into that large cup sitting at the counter in every single starbucks fuck you don t ever fuck up my battle i ll pick up your bitch and i ll hump her like my camel round dna did anybody see who he was talking to no me neither so why d y all think that was hot y all cause you looked up there for five seconds and talked to something unknown like a blocked call so diz why do you think you getting hot and like you gon grip a round me dna i m in canada my first time i ll rip the town show you how i m the illest and i m the realest with the sickest sound he kept mentioning hollow but it s like his battle with hitman cause when i pull it out i won t miss the pound see if y all really think about that now i m gonna try to stay calm and keep my cool b but i ve been watching king of the dot battles and i saw a dude that had potential we would soon see and i don t like bringing up people that died usually but truthfully this faggot should ve died instead of bruce b you re not a shot buster at blockbuster you wouldn t move e you dick ride and switch sides you a groupie i don t know that much about canadian change but i tell y all truthfully i know for a two dollar coin he ll be on his two knees so diz why would you even start though you act like you

registered to the joy of boissy d anglas and good malesherbes successive loan all protests expunged or else withdrawn remains open the rather as few or none come to fill it states general for which the parlement has clamoured and now the whole nation clamours will follow in five years if indeed not sooner o parlement of paris what a clamour was that messieurs said old d ormesson you will get states general and you will repent it like the horse in the fable who to be avenged of his enemy applied to the man the man mounted did swift execution on the enemy but unhappily would not dismount instead of five years let three years pass and this clamorous parlement shall have both seen its enemy hurled prostrate and been itself ridden to foundering say rather jugulated for hide and shoes and lie dead in the ditch under such omens however we have reached the spring of by no path can the king s government find passage for itself but is everywhere shamefully flung back beleaguered by twelve rebellious parlements which are grown to be the organs of an angry nation it can advance nowhither can accomplish nothing obtain nothing not so much as money to subsist on but must sit there seemingly to be eaten up of deficit the measure of the iniquity then of the falsehood which has been gathering through long centuries is nearly full at least that of the misery is for the hovels of the twenty five millions the misery permeating upwards and forwards as its law is has got so far to the very oeil de boeuf of versailles man s hand in this blind pain is set against man not only the low against the higher but the higher against each other provincial noblesse is bitter against court noblesse robe against sword rochet against pen but against the king s government who is not bitter not even besenval in these days to it all men and bodies of men are become as enemies it is the centre whereon infinite contentions unite and clash what new universal vertiginous movement is this of institution social arrangements individual minds which once worked cooperative now rolling and grinding in distracted collision inevitable it is the breaking up of a world solecism worn out at last down even to bankruptcy of money and so this poor versailles court as the chief or central solecism finds all the other solecisms arrayed against it most natural for your human solecism be it person or combination of persons is ever by law of nature uneasy if verging towards bankruptcy it is even miserable and when would the meanest solecism consent to blame or amend itself while there remained another to amend these threatening signs do not terrify lomenie much less teach him lomenie though of light nature is not without courage of a sort nay have we not read of lightest creatures trained canary birds that could fly cheerfully with lighted matches and fire cannon fire whole powder magazines to sit and die of deficit is no part of lomenie s plan the evil is considerable but can he not remove it can he not attack it at lowest he can attack the symptom of it these rebellious parlements he can attack and perhaps remove much is dim to lomenie but two things are clear that such parlementary duel with royalty is growing perilous nay internecine above all that money must be had take thought brave lomenie thou garde des sceaux lamoignon who hast ideas so often defeated balked cruelly when the golden fruit seemed within clutch rally for one other struggle to tame the parlement to fill the king s coffers these are now life and death questions parlements have been tamed more than once set to perch on the peaks of rocks in accessible except by litters a parlement grows reasonable o maupeou thou bold man had we left thy work where it was but apart from exile or other violent methods is there not one method whereby all things are tamed even lions the method of hunger what if the parlement s supplies were cut off namely its lawsuits minor courts for the trying of innumerable minor causes might be instituted these we could call grand bailliages whereon the parlement shortened of its prey would look with yellow despair but the public fond of cheap justice with favour and hope then for finance for registering of edicts why not from our own oeil de boeuf dignitaries our princes dukes marshals make a thing we could call plenary court and there so to speak do our registering ourselves st louis had his plenary court of great barons montgaillard i most useful to him our great barons are still here at least the name of them is still here our necessity is greater than his such is the lomenie lamoignon device welcome to the king s council as a light beam in great darkness the device seems feasible it is eminently needful be it once well executed great deliverance is wrought silent then and steady now or never the world shall see one other historical scene and so singular a man as lomenie de brienne still the stage manager there behold accordingly a home secretary breteuil beautifying paris in the peaceablest manner in this hopeful spring weather of the old hovels and hutches disappearing from our bridges as if for the state too there were halcyon weather and nothing to do but beautify parlement seems to sit acknowledged victor brienne says nothing of finance or even says and prints that it is all well how is this such halcyon quiet though the successive loan did not fill in a victorious parlement counsellor goeslard de monsabert even denounces that levying of the second twentieth on strict valuation and gets decree that the valuation shall not be strict not on the privileged classes nevertheless brienne endures it launches no lettre de cachet against it how is this smiling is such vernal weather but treacherous sudden for one thing we hear it whispered the intendants of provinces have all got order to be at their posts on a certain day still more singular what incessant printing is this that goes on at the king s chateau under lock and key sentries occupy all gates and windows the printers come not out they sleep in their workrooms their very food is handed in to them weber i a victorious parlement smells new danger d espremenil has ordered horses to versailles prowls round that guarded printing office prying snuffing if so be the sagacity and ingenuity of man may penetrate it to a shower of gold most things are penetrable d espremenil descends on the lap of a printer s danae in the shape of five hundred louis d or the danae s husband smuggles a ball of clay to her which she delivers to the golden counsellor of parlement kneaded within it their stick printed proof sheets by heaven the royal edict of that same self registering plenary court of those grand bailliages that shall cut short our lawsuits it is to be promulgated over all france on one and the same day this then is what the intendants were bid wait for at their posts this is what the court sat hatching as its accursed

Future,spotify:track:2IdlbULqKWB8IMzTuNLyoE,spirit phone commentary transcription lyricsintro hey buddies uh neil cicierega here i am lemon demon the musician that made spirit phone this album this is a commentary track for an album which is weird it s hard to talk and listen at the same time so after a few failed attempts i ended up writing a lot of notes so sometimes if i sound like i know what i m saying it s because i m reading from a script and other times uh i ll sound uh like you know what s the word bad so spirit phone began as soon as my last album view monster came out which was and it came out i still put out music in the intervening years but they were just short eps and sample based mashup albums this was a long in the works return to a full length original music album and there were multiple times when i thought i had this thing in the bag and i was always telling people like yeah it s gonna come out this year it s gonna come out next year it s almost done and y know all of these tracks were almost quote unquote done no matter how much i messed with them but eventually i figured it out lifetime achievement award so to rewind a bit this album starts off with some white noise some soft white noise spooky sounds and then the music begins the white noise returns throughout the album a few times what does it mean it s a ghost that s what it means this track is called lifetime achievement award i picked that title late in production i didn t feel like any lines from the actual chorus of the song worked as a title some early versions i think were named experiments in the revival which is a reference to experiments in the revival of organisms a s soviet medical film where they supposedly kept a severed dog s head alive with science i ve never actually watched this clip because it just sounds really disturbing although it s possibly fake but i m glad i didn t go with that title because it s maybe too freaky a reference right out of the gate nonetheless i ve got this whole song about creepy scientists reviving dead musicians reviving them straight into new contracts like performing animals this song idea goes back to when there was that whole i guess scandal about the hologram version of pac remember that i barely remember that but anyways the early s is where this song was born and the references to michael jackson s death and to katy perry sort of date it but not too badly because katy perry is still doing her thing and michael jackson s still dead the chorus uses in addition to me screaming a computer voice it s actually not a real one but an emulated atari speech synthesis program and those things are so bad at pronouncing things i had to break up the words into individual syllables just so it wouldn t be ce mah tree instead of cemetery an earlier version of this song was a totally different recording that i i just worked on it too long and it just started to sound bad to me so i scrapped almost everything and i recreated it from scratch and i listened to it recently and this always happens but i was like agh this is kinda better in some ways and that s just egh really aggravating but that version was missing a few important chunks i think and starting over made it easier to kinda insert a few extra bars here and there to spread out the lyrics a little bit and this pretty cool keyboard solo wasn t in that version so it was worth it i think but of course all my friends who i would send early versions of this song to when they heard the new version they did not like it as much that always seems to happen in fact that happened publicly because i put out an early version of reaganomics later on this album and people got used to listening to that version and then i changed a bunch of stuff and a lot of people did not like it as much now one solution to this is for me not to take eight years to make an album and uh don t feel guilty about not putting out enough content and end up releasing songs early in an unfinished state so people can just know that i m not dead and i m actually working on music but now i m not even talking about this song so let me let me stop myself right there actually the only note that i missed is earlier when i said you re unnatural babe which is a pun on you re a natural you re unnatural originally that was just you re unstoppable babe so i got a bad pun in there that s one thing i improved over the original cool most of my songs there s just one tempo that s locked in but for this i tried to add little moments where it slows down or give a drum fill a little room to breathe and that helps it makes it feel like a more alive song so this part is it s my voice going through a really deep synthesizer vocoder effect and i am paraphrasing the disclaimer that shows up at the beginning of the video for thriller where michael jackson i guess had a crisis of conscience and just had to make sure that everyone knows that ehh he s not a practitioner of magic or whatever so i just took that phrase because it s pretty well worded and i kinda turned it into a pledge of allegiance type call and response thing with some robots and for some reason with the robot voice the word record just sounded not robotic i had to say record recooord touch tone telephone making this little acapella intro involved like or different vocal tracks and some of them are doing like you know like the main chords in tune ba ba ba ba ba but then there s one track that s doing all the in between notes and that one sounds really funny on its own it s just me going flat ba ba ba ba ba ba i ve got a fake string quartet going in this song that to my ear sounds pretty good i ve always found that strings are one of the hardest instruments to make sound realistic using just a computer but i found a pretty good sound library that is sadly discontinued now so this song is about a dedicated caller into a radio show who has it all figured out and he just needs to explain it to someone and even just knowing how he s gonna sound to other people is giving him all this anxiety and it s coming out before he can even say what he wants so say in fact it never comes out so this song is just a big rant of preemptive defensiveness and saying you re gonna do something without ever doing it and i name drop robert stack and leonard nimoy who hosted respectively unsolved mysteries and in search of which were both shows that dealt with bizarre and often paranormal stories and tales and i actually love to read about ufos and paranormal stuff even though i m not a real believer when i was a kid it was just a fun thing to stretch my imagination with i guess on my patreon i posted an early early ancestor of this song called ivanushka which was based on the movie jack frost which was a mystery science theater episode and that song had a lot of different sounding parts but one of them was the basically the chorus of this song only i was singing about father mushroom and ivanushka and that happens all the time in my process i will find melodies in songs unfinished songs from years and years ago and since they re mine and i ve never done anything with them i m free to basically plagiarize myself and a lot of the time these melodies will just kinda stay in my head for years and that s how they ll end up getting reused i ll be going through old files and then i ll realize oh i actually did record this melody a long time ago and i totally forgot but the flip side of that is discovering something like that can be a little depressing cause it reminds me oh man i take so long to finish music writing this little rap here was great because i got to use a lot of little um just like phrases and stems that i had written in a big text file i always wanted to use like the word ufology in time with the lyrics or name dropping ancient aliens i actually just paused and checked my old lyrics txt file and yeah i totally wrote species of big cat i am robert stack ufology demonology all like in this little paragraph so i guess that s where this song came from and the super sargasso sea that i mention was a sort of thought experiment by charles fort who was a very interesting early cataloger of catalogist of the paranormal or seemingly impossible stories look him up this song always makes me think of once when i was a kid me and my dad were just messing around with a touch tone telephone and trying to play music on it and i think we were trying to play shave a haircut and we must have played the first notes and then hung up and those first notes just happened to be because a cop showed up at our door a little while later saying like hey we got a call and someone just hung up so i imagine my dad probably tried to explain what happened and the cop must have been just like uh ok please don t do that as this album was starting to come together and i was starting to get excited and see it as not just a collection of songs but it s an experience man i started extending the outros for songs and making these kind of swirling synthesizer soundscapes and i had to shorten this one because it was just too much but i ve always really liked the effect of a song kinda decompressing and getting you ready for the next track and not knowing exactly where the cut off point is cabinet man so this is cabinet man an upbeat song about a supernatural serial killer this is supposed to be the kind of ludicrous story that would show up in an old horror anthology like creepshow with lots of creative gore and vivid lights i don t really remember what inspired me to write this kind of story there is the urban legend of polybius a weird s arcade game that made people sick and lose their minds and die but the body horror element where a guy somehow medically transplants all his systems into a video game cabinet not sure what i was doing when i came up with that one there is real guitar in this but the underlying rhythm guitar is fake because i tried playing it myself and i got really bad hand cramps trying to keep up that rhythm there s also backup vocals that are filtered through a plug in called bitspeek which makes vocals sound like a speak and spell i also used it on melt everyone from mouth sounds on rob thomas s voice from the song smooth i ve also got a lot of really fast high hat hits here which i definitely did not play irl a lot of these songs use little synth instruments that have a random element to them they ll play you know a note an octave up or an octave down in a total random fashion and that is built into the plug in that s not how i m playing it which is good it adds some variety to the sound but the draw back is every single time i play the song it sounds a little bit different and that s true any time i export the song as well if i ever needed to go back and you know remix or re construct the song from the original files it would end up having a lot of little variations from the original one of the bonus tracks on spirit phone is like a more chill version of this song from it doesn t have any lyrics it was long before i thought of putting body parts in a video game cabinet i remember some early lyrics being about a seesaw i guess my content has changed a bit over the years i reversed the drums in this part which is something i forgot you could do i m glad i did it and of course you can t be a monster arcade cabinet without immediately having to reckon with becoming obsolete in the face of home consoles and portable consoles this guy is pretty much doomed to just be thrown away or end up living in some enthusiast s collection maybe be in like a movie theater lobby when i played this song live years ago i made a backup video or like a backing projected video that was clips from an s anthology movie about an evil arcade game called the bishop of battle i think it s from a movie called nightmares with emilio estevez it had a lot of cool visuals lots of s d wire frame stuff coming out of a screen and shooting lasers this is another song where none of the actual words in the lyrics grabbed me as title material so i guess i just came up with cabinet man cause it sounds kinda spooky also there s two other tracks with man in the title and i guess that s just a subtle way of unifying not really what am i talking about ooh this part sounds pretty cool right this was pretty high on my vocal register i just kinda had to yell it and overlay multiple tracks to make it sound okay it sounds okay no eyed girl after i came up with the order for the songs on the album i ended up having to go in and alter the intros and outros of the songs to make them fit together in a cool way so like this song was done and it came in with the little soft strum guitar and i ended up isolating a synth from later in the song and putting it right in the beginning with some nice echos to make it a more smooth transition into this song and also to make sure that there s you know there s occasionally more than seconds when i m not singing in the album so this song i had this melody which was always meant to sound very doo wop inspired and kinda sad but when i realized i don t have the vocal chops of old doo wop singers i somehow got the idea to just cheat with vocoder effects so i have my actual voice on the lead vocals plus like or backup vocals put through vocoders and you know these are plug in vocoders not actual physical devices that i own so there s those tracks plus all these synthesizer tracks that are pushing the melodies through onto those vocals and if i took those synths out there could be a version of this song with all natural voices but it would sound awful because i wasn t very concerned with hitting notes the synths were doing that work the lyrics are another hypothetical sci fi short story just an intro dimensional love story with really bad repercussions the sort of thing that people were worried the large hadron collider would unleash on the world this all blossomed from the title just a dumb pun on brown eyed girl you know just like the weirdness of eye color in love songs cause eyes are like the window to the soul that we fall in love with put them on a pedestal but they re really just another body part at the end of the day i don t know i like eyes and all but they re just the window to the eyes earlier on i had more realistic drums on this version of the song but for some reason they just weren t sounding right and i don t know why i decided to add kind of these s sampled new jack swing big drums but i think it worked recording really quiet parts with vocals is tough because i have never had any kind of isolated sound booths i ve never even tried really sometimes i ll throw a blanket over my computer so recording something like that was kinda tough i d have to get pretty close to the mic and cut off any room noise at the end of a word stuff like that and this breakdown section was kind of an interesting thing to produce because i guess i just started with just the synths playing kind of like you know solid tones with no real volume variation then i sat down with a microphone and basically just recorded myself humming into the microphone to add some intonation to the synths so for like the bass i wouldn t be worrying about the note i would just be going buuuuuum woooooaaaaooow and then you know once i put it all together i had the right notes at the right volumes and it all sounded pretty cool i guess this one has a happy ending sorta like as a romance my favorite vocal track happens during this part and it s when it s like half faded out but it s the this part the woah woah woah harmony that s me acknowledging that adding a ton of reverb smooths things out and to transition into when he died which is more of an explicitly horror themed song i recorded these janky synths to an actual cassette tape and i played them back through this vintage radioshack battery operated cassette player and if you pick it up and you shake it it sounds very warble y and very spooky i highly recommend listening to all music in this way when he died so this is another kind of doo wop with a weird twist type of song it uses that classic chord s progression i believe it s called but it switches between lydian and diatonic scales for the first two and the last two chords of that progression and what that means is that there s literally like one note that is off from what you d expect from this kind of song you can t hear it on my vocals but it s in some of the backup instruments and the guitar solo that comes later everyone always compares this glockenspiel part to the theme from rugrats and i disagree it s clearly supposed to evoke take me there by blackstreet totally different song you can hear some flourishes from this janky little toy wooden harp that s like tuned beyond saving you can hear it in its full glory whenever snape appears in the potter puppet pals halloween special that i made some years back i definitely have a habit of finding and collecting weird little instruments like that and forgetting to use them or just not finding a place to use them so i m glad when i can use a messed up harp in a song chuckles key change chorus that s a cheap but effective trick in songwriting i really like the pitched up la la las in the right channel they sound like cartoon cats does anyone remember like statues that cried blood that was a thing i think i probably saw it in an episode of sightings maybe on the sci fi channel when i was working on this song they might be giants came out with a song called when will you die and i was briefly worried that they would be too similar but thankfully they re very different but i do highly recommend that song for the record it s a good one and that harp is now replaced by a harmonica because that s another instrument i just had laying around and didn t really know how to play it correctly so just wanted to get it in there justify owning a harmonica so the okeh laughing record was a s novelty record that was just some people laughing together the idea was that laughing is infectious so this record should sell like hotcakes and it did it was a huge hit but when i listened to it i thought it was the scariest thing i ve ever heard and it s public domain so i got to scratch my sampling itch on this album by the way if you have the vinyl version of this album i definitely recommend after the rd side is done playing just let it keep playing and there should be a little surprise there in the center of the disc and by the way people seem to have trouble interpreting this song but it s really it s just a litany of creepy mysterious things being discovered about someone who s died you hear about stuff like this every now and then but i like that this one guy really outdid everyone and he made sure to leave a real mystery behind so that s the concept of the song just a guy who s death raised far far far more questions than it could ever answer ah i really hit that note there i m pretty happy with my vocals on this track i feel like the melody of this song is pretty up and down probably one of the harder ones to do that being said there s a lot of little notes that i would love to go in and do better or they just sound off now but i guess that means i m improving that i can hear those imperfections i know when i was younger i couldn t i didn t think i was good but i just couldn t tell i was specifically really bad and if you listen closely there s like a little heartbeat kick drum here sweet bod so this is sweet bod it s weird subject matter even for me i had to run this song by my loved ones and i got a lot of uh i don t know man responses but it s inspired by the mellified man a legend that spans multiple cultures but it probably never happened in where an old guy would willingly eat nothing but honey until he died so that he could be buried in a coffin of yet more honey and after years he would just kinda turn into a confection with incredible healing properties it s sort of like being an organ donor it s a nice thought anyway but my idea was how do you pitch that to someone like hey uh so i have this theory do you like honey somehow this lyrical concept got paired with a jam that i was working on and something about setting it to music just made it take on an unintentionally perverse tone so instead of scrapping the song i thought well what if the singer just tries to clarify it s not a sex thing but good god that only makes it worse i guess that s probably why it s only a legend and it never actually really happened it just skeeved people out too much but in the end i liked having a funk song that required too much explanation and defensiveness cause i think singing about someone else s body is weird and commodifing as it is so it was a natural fit i thought one of the bonus tracks is a demo for this song and it s just an earlier version of the song with the same lyrics but a harder synth sound it was just too fast and hard to listen to i like the big synth breakdown in the middle of it but that just didn t translate to the new funk direction so it s pretty different and to go back further before it had any music the lyrics were originally tied into the boston molasses flood of which actually killed a bunch of people and the premise would have been about how on the year anniversary of that these jars of sweet liquid cure all would start turning up being sold on the streets of boston but real people died in that tragedy and i felt like the one weird legend was enough for a song and the guitar solo here is the only guest spot on the album and it s dave kitsburg a really gifted player who s uh he s done live shows with me and i ve got that same bitspeek plug in running on the guitar and a few of the other synths on this song my overall direction was to try and make it sound like there was this real vintage funk song kind of buried under modern and unique sounds some of the backup vocals are pitched up a bit to sound like i have both male and female singers but nope it s just me and yes i finally got to use the word panacea in a song and those high pitched cowbells which i ve always loved i love that kinda shit like those little uh those little tiny tom drums that stuff s good and there s some uh like chopping up of the song here that i added pretty much at the last minute like in the mixing mastering stage sw t bod eighth wonder so this is eighth wonder this is the oldest track on the album it was originally released in but it s held up pretty well and it fits the spirit phone theme and it never got an official release so into the album it went and i didn t really change much about it i added a little bit of flanger to this intro and y know tweaked the eq and the mixing and all that stuff but it s pretty much the same track i released back in there was actually this like extended fiddle solo outro that i chopped off at least for the music video which is where most people heard it so that part s kinda discontinued i guess but most of the lyrics come from quotes from this old ghost story or poltergeist maybe or just a talking animal it was reported by a young girl and her family on the isle of man in i think the s so look up gef the mongoose g e f this story stuck out to me because he is so childish and quotable and talkative for a ghost he s cracking jokes and he s insulting people and making outlandish claims but he s totally hidden and nobody can really see him they catch glimpses of a mongoose sometimes but they don t really see this talking character and if you read some of the original reporting on him he has such a memorable presence without ever coming out into the open he s just a voice in the wall i fell in love with this story because well like with a lot of paranormal stories and ghost stories the people involved swear up and down pretty convincingly that it really happened but what makes it different is it s the kind of story a little kid would tell not understanding that it s not a believable lie but it s told in a believable way so it has the effect of not just challenging what you think the rules of the universe are but challenging that there are any rules so letting yourself get drawn into the story is in a way creepier than a story that is more quote unquote plausible i got some real bass in this song which i don t often do i remember recording this in the basement of my family s house and it was probably one of the last songs i made there before i moved to the city and i shot the music video in my family s yard in the woods that i grew up near and this old shack that s on our property line so this song has a real end of an era feel to me i think i made this song around the same time as redesign your logo and they re both the start of a lot of samples and sounds that i continue to use up until today really the drum sounds the strings the imitation analog synths as well as trying a little bit harder on my vocals so it s like i tapped into something pretty good with this song it just ended up sounding a lot better than anything else i was doing at the time and i m realizing now if i hadn t made this song or if it had just turned out totally differently there are a lot of things i wouldn t have even tried in music for the next few years because it was just a confidence booster to have accidentally made a song that sounds like a real song so that s eighth wonder this ending was a new composition for the album it took a lot of effort not to make it it s own track i went overboard with splitting my last album view monster into like different tracks including all the transitions so i really had to keep myself in check this time no superfluous concept tracks or anything and i wrote this little melody just to modulate the last song s ending chord into something that matches the next song s intro chord but it actually ended up being one of my favorite moments on the album it sounds kinda like a creepy soft lullaby with a vacuum cleaner going in the other room ancient aliens this intro part is me playing the organ patch on an old casio keyboard that i found at a thrift store and singing along i added like one extra vocal track but the first vocal and the organ are performed together in one recording which isn t that interesting but it s something that i don t usually do i don t usually sing and play an instrument at the same time i think recording just by myself at home without no need to book studio time is totally a double edge sword because on one hand i end up dragging out the process of making a song for way way too long and i haven t honed the skills of just getting in there and recording what you need to do and getting out but on the other hand it s a lot more flexible and creative ideas don t have to stop just because i m in the middle of recording i can always just stop singing and get back to work on the instruments or add more tracks and develop a harmony or something that would be impossible or just a big headache if you were booking studio time or working with someone else and having to respect their schedule this song is a good example of one that went through a lot of revisions and rethinkings and originally it was a really relentless constant drum beat kinda song and i did stuff like i added this no stars part that s an extra two beats that weren t there originally and i stripped it down mostly to just kick and snare in the drums and i tried to add more stop and go variation in this song and you ll notice that s a recurring theme with the edits that i ended up making to these songs and even still one of the main criticisms i get for this album is that it just has too much energy that lasts for way too long which ok just y know just don t listen to it all at once i guess man i i can t believe i did these falsetto notes here it sounds ok though so this song is from the point of view of a caveman who s meeting an alien and he just knows that it s wrong and he can t deal with it and i guess the alien is stranded or in need of help in some way and the caveman just refuses to help because he gets a primal reaction from meeting someone not of the earth of course in reality cave people were probably freaked out all the time by totally natural things too i like the random square notes that are playing in this part almost all the synths in my songs these days are from a plugin called synth one which is very popular and free and it s just a good all around synth it can do a little bit of everything and i m happy to say that finally i pretty much know what all of the knobs do i can make my own custom patches or emulate synths i ve heard in other songs and when i was younger that stuff was just black magic to me and i had no idea how any of it did and it looked suspiciously like math so i didn t really try one thing i miss is my parents had this really old early s monophonic synthesizer and i used to plug it in and mess with it and have no idea what i was doing but there s something really satisfying about physically turning a knob and seeing a light blink faster or slower and hearing the sound transform but it would drive me nuts trying to record like that because i always wanna tweak everything at every stage of production and having to decide how somethings gonna sound and then record it and then be stuck with that is not my idea of a good time case in point i got another one of these swirly synth y outros going here and the synthesizer here required a lot of finagling and going back and forth and making it softer or adding more of a gliding portamento between the notes and there s different synthesizers playing right now and they all needed that kinda flexibility to get this sound soft fuzzy man this song is called soft fuzzy man and that s something that me and my wife now call our cat originally the opening line was hello sally hello suzy let me float your way and introduce me which was probably too awkward and torture to rhyme even for me an early early version of this song also had the don t worry bill murray rhyme couplet that i used on pokemon i think in like i think that was just temporary lyrics that i ended up recycling but yeah that means that the melody and bassline for this are even older than might have been like dinosaurchestra era like or something this is me playing guitar badly but i m using that bitspeek plug in again it s very unique sounding it s kinda like a kazoo this song is about a cloud man or a ghost or maybe just a metaphor for someone who thinks that being a total mystery makes him attractive and i do the thing that i usually do and i figure out an underlying metaphor and that s good enough and now i can move on and just have fun with the literal side of the lyrics so there s something about male unrelatability in there but mostly it s just a cloud man song the drums in this song are just like a bunch of really compressed claps and cowbells that are being wildly tuned up and down i always feel like the bridge is a good place to attempt to humanize a weird character that i m singing about like yeah jokes jokes jokes but no i m serious ok back to jokes i think rhyming the word nervous with surface is within the acceptable range of rhymes in an early version of this song i had the line change each time so i d say what you girls really need s a nebulous man or a fragmental man and i kinda miss those lines cause fragmental is a good word makes you see spots is a line change i had something about seeping through the vents before either way he s some kind of poisonous gas maybe i think i specified that he s hitting on a whole group of women at once to try and undercut the creepiness of this noxious pervasive character that s still the point but at least he s outnumbered the final thing i did is this little vocal thing here reminds me of cornelius as your father i expressly forbid it as your father i expressly forbid it i liked doing such a simple bass and guitar riff there s still some good chord changes in this song but they re all lumped together in one part of the verse then it comes back to that riff for the chorus just louder it s actually so simple i m curious if this mimics the riff thing has been done before if anyone has found a prior use please let me know this is yet another unpleasant character but uh i liked doing this cartoon ish strict dad cause it let me yell most of the lyrics instead of sing cause all i really wanted to do was say things like don t talk about the internet in an unhinged manner so this title is in the present tense and i went back and forth a couple times thinking like uh am i using the word expressly correctly does it matter it just feels like something that you ve heard a dad say in a movie at some point but i don t think it is it made me think of king triton from the little mermaid and i ll talk abou,"['dog', 'ce', 'drop', 'brown', 'laugh', 'pun', 'pledge', 'bonus', 'note',

entertainment went in the teachers lounge for a little banquet no property damage or even destruction just a few kids throwing a lil harmless function we got ten days in the clink we should have gotten less now don t you think take a listen you might be surprised at what lisd is letting slide days for vape days for rape knock a chick out and then call it a date days for weed days for the roof

uman and his sons sharrkan and zau al makan and what befel them of things seld seen and peregrine fn the king asked her and what was their story and she answered it hath reached me o auspicious king that there was in the city of safety baghdad before the caliphate of abd al malik bin marw n fn a king omar bin al nu um n highs who was of the mighty giants and had subjected the chosro s of persia and the kaysars of eastern rome for none could warm himself at his fire fn nor could any avail to meet him in the field of foray and fray and when he was angered there came forth from his nostrils sparks of flame he had made himself king over all quarters and allah had subjected to him all his creatures his word went forth to all great cities and his hosts had harried the farthest lands east and west had come under his command with whatsoever regions lay interspersed between them hind and sind and sin fn the holy land al hijaz the rich mountains of al yaman and the archipelagos of india and china moreover he reigned supreme over the north country and diy r bakr or mesopotamia and over sud n the eastern negro land and the islands of the ocean and all the far famed rivers of the earth sayh n and jayh n fn nile and euphrates he sent envoys and ambassadors to capitals the most remote to provide him with true report and they would bring back tidings of justice and peace with assurance of loyalty and obedience and of prayers in the pulpits for king omar bin al nu uman for he was o ruler of the age a right noble king and there came to him presents of rarities and toll and tribute from all lands of his governing this mighty monarch had a son yclept sharrkan fn who was likest of all men to his father and who proved himself one of the prodigies of his time for subduing the brave and bringing his contemporaries to bane and ban for this his father loved him with love so great none could be greater and made him heir to the kingdom after himself this prince grew up till he reached man s estate and was twenty years old and allah subjected his servants to him by reason of his great might and prowess in battle now his father king omar had four wives legally married but allah had vouchsafed him no son by them save sharrkan whom he had begotten upon one of them and the rest were barren moreover he had three hundred and sixty concubines after the number of days in the coptic year who were of all nations and he had furnished for each and every a private chamber within his own palace for he had built twelve pavilions after the number of the months each containing thirty private chambers which thus numbered three hundred and three score wherein he lodged his handmaids and he appointed according to law for each one her night when he lay with her and came not again to her for a full year fn and on this wise he abode for a length of time meanwhile his son sharrkan was making himself renowned in all quarters of the world and his father was proud of him and his might waxed and grew mightier so that he passed all bounds and bore himself masterfully and took by storm castles and cities presently by decree of the decreer a handmaid among the handmaids of omar bin nu uman became pregnant and her pregnancy being announced to the harim the king was informed thereof whereupon he rejoiced with exceeding joy and said haply it will be a son and so all my offspring will be males then he documented the date of her conception and entreated her with all manner of kindness but when the tidings came to sharrkan he was troubled and the matter seemed to him a sore one and a grievous and he said verily one cometh who shall dispute with me the sovereignty so quoth he to himself if this concubine bear a male child i will kill it but he kept that intention hidden in his heart such was the case with sharrkan but what happened in the matter of the damsel was as follows she was a roumiyah a greek girl by name sofiyah or sophia fn whom the king of roum and lord of c sarea had sent to king omar as a present together with great store of gifts and of rarities she was the fairest of favour and loveliest of all his handmaids and the most regardful of her honour and she was gifted with a wit as penetrating as her presence was fascinating now she had served the king on the night of his sleeping with her saying to him o king i desire of the god of the heavens that he bless thee this night with a male child by me so i may bring him up with the best of rearing and enable him to reach man s estate perfect in intelligence good manners and prudent bearing fn a speech which much pleased the king during her pregnancy she was instant in prayer fervently supplicating the lord to bless her with a goodly male child and make his birth easy to her and allah heard her petition so that after her months were accomplished she sat safely upon the birth stool fn now the king had deputed a eunuch to let him know if the child she should bring forth were male or female and in like way his son sharrkan had sent one to bring him tidings of the same in due time sophia was delivered of a child which the midwives examined and found to be a girl with a face sheenier than the moon so they announced this to all present in the room whereupon the king s messenger carried the news to him and sharrkan s eunuch did the like with his master who rejoiced with exceeding joy but after the two had departed quoth sophia to the midwives wait with me awhile for i feel as if there were still somewhat in my womb then she cried out and the pains of child bed again took her and allah made it easy to her and she gave birth to a second child the wise women looked at it and found it a boy like the full moon with forehead flower white and cheek ruddy bright with rosy light whereupon the mother rejoiced as did the eunuchs and attendants and all the company and sophia was delivered of the after birth whilst all in the palace sent forth the trill of joy fn the rest of the concubines heard it and envied her lot and the tidings reached omar son of al nu uman who was glad and rejoiced at the excellent news then he rose and went to her and kissed her head after which he looked at the boy and bending over him kissed him whilst the damsels struck the tabors and played on instruments of music and the king gave order that the boy should be named zau al mak n and his sister nuzhat al zam n fn they answered hearing and obedience and did his bidding so he appointed wet nurses and dry nurses and eunuchs and attendants to serve them and assigned them rations of sugar and diet drinks and unguents and else beside beyond the power of tongue to rehearse moreover the people of baghdad hearing that allah had blessed their king with issue decorated the city and made proclamation of the glad tidings with drum and tom tom and the emirs and wazirs and high dignitaries came to the palace and wished king omar bin al nu uman joy of his son zau al makan and of his daughter nuzhat al zaman wherefore he thanked them and bestowed on them dresses of honour and further favoured them with gifts and dealt largesse to all gentle and simple who were present after this fashion he did for four days full told and he lavished upon sophia raiment and ornaments and great store of wealth and every few days he would send a messenger to ask after her and the new borns and when four years had gone by he provided her with the wherewithal to rear the two children carefully and educate them with the best of instructions all this while his son sharrkan knew not that a male child had been born to his father omar son of al nu uman having news only that he had been blessed with the birth of nuzhat al zaman and they hid the intelligence from him until days and years had sped by whilst he was busied in battling with the brave and fighting single handed against the knights one day as king omar was sitting in his palace his chamberlains came in to him and kissing the ground before him said o king there be come ambassadors from the king of roum lord of constantinople the great and they desire admission to thee and submission to thy decree if the king commend us to introduce them we will so do and if not there is no disputing his behest he bade them enter and when they came in he turned to them and courteously receiving them asked them of their case and what was the cause of their coming they kissed the ground before him and said o king glorious and strong o lord of the arm that is long know that he who despatched us to thee is king afr d n fn lord of ionia land fn and of the nazarene armies the sovereign who is firmly established in the empery of constantinople to acquaint thee that he is now waging fierce war and fell with a tyrant and a rebel the prince of casarea and the cause of this war is as follows one of the kings of the arabs in past time during certain of his conquests chanced upon a hoard of the time of alexander fn whence he removed wealth past compute and amongst other things three round jewels big as ostrich eggs from a mine of pure white gems whose like was never seen by man upon each were graven characts in ionian characters and they have many virtues and properties amongst the rest that if one of these jewels be hung round the neck of a new born child no evil shall befal him and he shall neither wail nor shall fever ail him as long as the jewel remain without fail fn when the arab king laid hands upon them and learned their secrets he sent to king afridun presents of certain rarities and amongst them the three jewels afore mentioned and he equipped for the mission two ships one bearing the treasure and the other men of might to guard it from any who might offer hindrance on the high seas albeit well assured that none would dare waylay his vessels for that he was king of the arabs and more by token that their course lay over waters subject to the king of constantinople and they were bound to his port nor were there on the shores of that sea any save the subjects of the great king afridun the two ships set out and voyaged till they drew near our city when there sallied out on them certain corsairs from that country and amongst them troops from the prince of caesarea who took all the treasures and rarities in the ships together with the three jewels and slew the crews when our king heard of this he sent an army against them but they routed it then he marched a second and a stronger but they put this also to flight whereupon the king waxed wroth and swore that he would not go forth fn against them save in his own person at the head of his whole army nor would he turn back from them till he had left caesarea of armenia fn in ruins and had laid waste all the lands and cities over which her prince held sway so he sent us to the lord of the age and the time sultan omar bin al nu uman king of baghdad and of khorasan desiring that he aid us with an army so may honour and glory accrue to him and he hath also forwarded by us somewhat of various kinds of presents and of the king s grace he beggeth their acceptance and the friendly boon of furtherance then the ambassadors kissed the ground before him and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say when it was the forty sixth night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that after the ambassadors and retinue from the constantinopolitan king had kissed the ground before omar and had delivered their embassage they brought out the presents which were fifty damsels of the choicest from graecia land and fifty mamelukes in tunics of brocade belted with girdles of gold and silver each wearing in his ears hoops of gold with pendants of fine pearls costing a thousand ducats every one the girls were adorned in like fashion and were clad in stuffs worth a treasury of money when the king saw them he rejoiced in them and accepted them then he bade the ambassadors be honourably entreated and summoning his wazirs took counsel with them of what he should do herewith rose up among them a wazir an ancient man dandan fn highs who kissed the ground before omar and said o king there is nothing better to do in this matter than equip an army valiant and victorious and set over it thy son sharrkan with us as his lieutenants and this rede commendeth itself to me on two counts first because the king of roum hath invoked thine assistance and hath sent thee gifts which thou hast accepted and secondly because while no enemy dareth attack our country thine army may go forth safely and should it succour the king of graecia land and defeat his foe the glory will be thine moreover the news of it will be noised abroad in all cities and countries and especially when the tidings shall reach the islands of the ocean and the kings of mauritania shall hear it they will send thee offerings of rarities and pay thee tribute of money the king pleased by the wazir s words and approving his rede gave him a dress of honour and said to him of the like of thee should kings ask counsel and it seemeth fit that thou shouldst conduct the van of our army and our son sharrkan command the main battle then he sent for his son who came and kissed ground before him and sat down and he expounded to him the matter telling him what the ambassadors and the wazir dandan had said and he charged him to take arms and equip himself for the campaign enjoining him not to gainsay dandan in aught he should do moreover he ordered him to pick out of his army ten thousand horsemen armed cap pie and inured to onset and stress of war accordingly sharrkan arose on the instant and chose out a myriad of horsemen after which he entered his palace and mustered his host and distributed largesse to them saying ye have delay of three days they kissed the earth before him in obedience to his commands and began at once to lay in munitions and provide provisions for the occasion whilst sharrkan repaired to the armouries and took therefrom whatsoever he required of arms and armour and thence to the stable where he chose horses of choice blood and others when the appointed three days were ended the army drew out to the suburbs of baghdad city fn and king omar came forth to take leave of his son who kissed the ground before him and received from the king seven parcels of money fn then he turned to danden and commended to his care the army of his son and the wazir kissed the ground before him and answered i hear and i obey and lastly he charged sharrkan that he should consult the wazir on all occasions which he promised to do after this the king returned to his city and sharrkan ordered the officers to muster their troops in battle array so they mustered them and their number was ten thousand horsemen besides footmen and camp followers then they loaded their baggage on their beasts and the war drums beat and the trumpets blared and the bannerols and standards were unfurled whilst sharrkan mounted horse with the wazir dandan by his side and the colours fluttering over their heads so the host fared forth and stinted not faring with the ambassadors preceding them till day departed and night drew nigh when they alighted and encamped for the night and as soon as allah caused the morn tomorrow they mounted and tried on guided by the ambassadors for a space of twenty days and by the night of the twenty first they came to a fine and spacious wady well grown with trees and shrubbery here sharrkan ordered them to alight and commanded a three days halt so they dismounted and pitched their tents spreading their camp over the right and the left slopes of the extensive valley whilst the wazir dandan and the ambassadors of king afridun pitched in the sole of the wady fn as for sharrkan he tarried behind them for awhile till all had dismounted and had dispersed themselves over the valley sides he then slacked the reins of his steed being minded to explore the wady and to mount guard in his own person because of his father s charge and owing to the fact that they were on the frontier of graecia land and in the enemy s country so he rode out alone after ordering his armed slaves and his body guard to camp near the wazir dandan and he fared on along the side of the valley till a fourth part of the night was passed when he felt tired and drowsiness overcame him so that he could no longer urge horse with heel now he was accustomed to take rest on horseback so when slumber overpowered him he slept and the steed ceased not going on with him till half the night was spent and entered one of the thickets fn which was dense with growth but sharrkan awoke not until his horse stumbled over wooded ground then he started from sleep and found himself among the trees and the moon arose and shone brightly over the two horizons eastern and western he was startled when he found himself alone in this place and said the say which ne er yet shamed its sayer there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great but as he rode on in fear of wild beasts behold the moon spread her glad light over a meadow as if it were of the meads of paradise and he heard pleasant voices and a loud noise of talk and laughter captivating the senses of men so king sharrkan alighted and tying his steed to one of the trees went over a little way till he came upon a stream and heard a woman talking in arabic and saying now by the crush of the messiah this is not well of you but whose utters a word i will throw her and truss her up with her own girdle fn he kept walking in the direction of the sound and when he reached the further side he looked and behold a stream was gushing and flowing and antelopes at large were frisking and roving and wild cattle amid the pasture moving and birds expressed joy and gladness in their divers tongues and that place was purfled with all manner flowers and green herbs even as a poet described it in these couplets most beautiful is earth in budding bloom when lucid waters course through plain and wood no work but his th all great th all glorious giver of all gifts giver of all good and as sharrkan considered the place he saw in it a christian monastery within whose enceinte a castle towered high in air catching the light of the moon fn through the midst of the convent passed a stream the water flowing amongst its gardens and upon the bank sat the woman whose voice he had heard while before her stood ten handmaids like moons and wearing various sorts of raiment and ornaments that dazed and dazzled the beholder high bosomed virgins as saith of them the poet in these couplets the mead is bright with what is on t of merry maidens debonnair double its beauty and its grace those trooping damsels slender fair virgins of graceful swimming gait ready with eye and lip to ensnare and like the tendril d vine they loose the rich profusion of their hair shooting their shafts and arrows from beautiful eyes beyond compare overpowering and transpiercing every froward adversaire sharrkan gazed upon the ten girls and saw in their midst a lady like the moon at fullest with ringleted hair and forehead sheeny white and eyes wondrous wide and black and bright and temple locks like the scorpion s tail and she was perfect in essence and attributes as the poet said of her in these couplets she beamed on my sight with a wondrous glance and her straight slender stature enshamed the lance she burst on my sight with cheeks rosy red where all manner of beauties have habitance and the locks on her forehead were lowering as night whence issues a dawn tide of happiest chance then sharrkan heard her say to the handmaids come ye on that i may wrestle with you and gravel you ere the moon set and the dawn break so each came up to her in turn and she grounded them forthright and pinioned them with their girdles and ceased not wrestling and pitching them until she had overthrown one and all then there turned to her an old woman who was before her and the beldam said as in wrath o strumpet cost thou glory in grounding these girls behold i am an old woman yet have i thrown them forty times so what hast thou to boast of but if thou have the strength to wrestle with me stand up that i may grip thee and set thy head between thy heels the young lady smiled at her words but she was filled with inward wrath and she jumped up and asked o my lady zat al dawahi fn by the truth of the messiah wilt thou wrestle with me in very deed or dost thou jest with me and she answered yea and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say when it was the forty seventh night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the young lady asked zat al dawahi by the truth of the messiah wilt wrestle with me or dost jest and she answered yea i will wrestle with thee in very deed sharrkan looking on the while the damsel cried rise up for the fall an thou have spunk so to do when the old woman heard this she raged with exceeding rage and her body hair stood on end like the bristles of a fretful hedgehog fn then she sprang to her feet whilst the damsel stood up to her and said now by the truth of the messiah i will not wrestle with thee unless i be naked mistress whore fn so she loosed her petticoat trousers and putting her hand under her clothes tore them off her body then twisted up a silken kerchief into cord shape girt it round her middle and became as she were a scald head if ritah or a spotted snake with this she inclined towards the damsel and said do thou as i have done all this time sharrkan was gazing at the twain and laughing at the beldam s loathly semblance so the damsel leisurely rose and taking a sash of yamani stuff passed it twice round her waist then she tucked up her trousers and displayed two calves of alabaster carrying a mound of crystal smooth and rounded and a stomach which exhaled musk from its dimples as it were a bed of nu uman s anemones and breasts like double pomegranates then the old woman leant towards her and the two laid hold either of each while sharrkan raised his head heavenwards and prayed allah that the belle might beat the beldam presently the young woman get beneath the old woman and gripping her waist cloth with the left and circling her neck with the right hand hoisted her off the ground with both whereupon the old woman strove to free herself and in so doing fell on her back arsiversy with her legs high in air and her hairy bush between them showed manifest in the moonshine furthermore she let fly two great farts fn one of which blew up the dust from the earth s face and the other steamed up to the gate of heaven sharrkan laughed till he fell back upon the ground then he arose and baring his brand looked right and left but he saw no one save the old woman sprawling on her back and said to himself he lied not who named thee lady of calamities verily thou knewest her prowess by her performance upon the others so he drew near them to hear what should pass between them then the young lady went up to the old one and throwing a wrapper of thin silk upon her nakedness helped her to don her clothes and made excuses saying o my lady zat al dawahi i intended only to throw thee and not all this but thou triedst to twist out of my hands so laud to allah for safety she returned her no answer but rose in her shame and walked away till out of sight leaving the handmaids prostrate and pinioned with the fair damsel standing amongst them quoth sharrkan to himself every luck hath its cause sleep did not fall upon me nor the war horse bear me hither save for my good fortune for doubtless this maid and what is with her shall become booty to me so he made towards his steed and mounted and heeled fn him on when he sped as the shaft speeds from the bow and in his hand he still hent his brand bare of sheath which he brandished shouting the while his war cry allah is all mighty fn when the damsel saw him she sprang to her feet and taking firm stand on the bank of the stream whose breadth was six ells the normal cubits made one bound and landed clear on the farther side fn where she turned and cried out with a loud voice who art thou o thou fellow that breakest in upon our privacy and pastime and that too hanger in hand as if charging a host whence camest thou and whither art thou going speak sooth for truth will stand thee in good stead and lie not for lies come of villein breed doubtless thou hast wandered this night from thy way that thou chancedst upon this place whence escape were the greatest of mercies for thou art now in an open plain and did we shout but a single shout would come to our rescue four thousand knights fn so tell me what thou wantest and if thou wouldst only have us set thee on the right road we will do so when sharrkan heard her words he replied i am a stranger of the moslems who fared forth this night single handed seeking for spoil nor could this moonlight show me a fairer booty than these ten maidens so i shall seize them and rejoin my comrades with them quoth she i would have thee know that as for the booty thou hast not come at it and as for the handmaids by allah they shall never be thy spoil have i not told thee that to lie is villein vile quoth he the wise man is he who taketh warning by others thereupon quoth she by the truth of the messiah did i not fear that thy death would be on my hands i would shout a shout should fill the mead for thee with war steeds and with men of might but i take pity upon the stranger so if thou seek booty i require of thee that thou alight from thy steed and swear to me by thy faith that thou wilt not advance against me aught like arms in hand and we will wrestle i and thou if thou throw me set me on thy steed and take all of us to thy booty but if i throw thee thou shalt become under my command swear this to me for i fear thy treachery indeed it hath become a common saw where perfidy is innate there trust is a weakly mate now an thou wilt swear i will return and draw near to thee and tackle thee answered sharrkan and indeed he lusted to seize her and said in his soul truly she knoweth not that i am a champion of champions swear me by what oath thou wilt and by what thou deemest most binding and i will not approach thee with aught till thou hast made thy preparation and sayest draw near that i wrestle with thee if thou throw me i have money where withal to ransom myself and if i throw thee twill be booty and booty enough for me rejoined the damsel i am content herewith and sharrkan was astounded at her words and said and by the truth of the apostle whom allah bless and keep i too am content on the other part then said she swear to me by him who sprite in body dight and dealt laws to rule man kind aright that thou wilt not offer me aught of violence save by way of wrestling else mayst thou die without the pale of al islam sharrkan replied by allah were a kazi to swear me even though he were a kazi of the kazis fn he would not impose upon me such an oath as this then he sware to her by all she named and tied his steed to a tree but he was drowned in the sea of thought saying in himself praise be to him who fashioned her from dirty water fn then he girt himself and made ready for wrestling and said to her cross the stream to me but she replied it is not for me to come over to thee if thou wilt pass thou over here to me i cannot do that quoth he and quoth she o boy i will come across to thee so she tucked up her skirts and leaping landed on the other side of the stream by his side whereupon he drew near to her and bent him forwards and clapped palms fn but he was confounded by her beauty and loveliness for he saw a shape which the hand of power had tanned with the dye leaves of the jann which had been fostered by the hand of beneficence and fanned by the zephyrs of fair fortune and whose birth a propitious ascendant had greeted then she called out to him o moslem come on and let us wrestle ere the break of morning and tucked up her sleeves from a forearm like fresh curd which illumined the whole place with its whiteness and sharrkan was dazzled by it then he bent forwards and clapped his palms by way of challenge she doing the like and caught hold of her and the two grappled and gripped and interlocked hands and arms presently he shifted his hands to her slender waist when his finger tips sank into the soft folds of her middle breeding languishment and he fell a trembling like the persian reed in the roaring gale so she lifted him up and throwing him to the ground sat upon his breast with hips and hinder cheeks like mounds of sand for his soul had lost mastery over his senses then she asked him o moslem the slaying of nazarenes is lawful to you folk what then hast thou to say about being slain thyself and he answered o my lady thy speech as regards slaying me is not other than unlawful for our prophet mohammed whom allah bless and preserve prohibited the slaying of women and children old men and monks as it was thus revealed to your prophet she replied it behoveth us to render the equivalent of his mercy so rise i give thee thy life for generosity is never lost upon the generous then she got off his breast and he rose and stood shaking the dust from his head against the owners of the curved rib even women and she said to him be not ashamed but verily one who entereth the land of roum in quest of booty and cometh to assist kings against kings how happeneth it that he hath not strength enough to defend himself from one made out of the curved rib twas not for lack of strength in me he answered nor didst thou throw me by thy force it was thy loveliness overthrew me so if thou wilt grant me another bout it will be of thy courtesy she laughed and said i grant thee thy request but these handmaids have long been pinioned and their arms and sides are weary and it were only right i should loose them for haply this next wrestling bout will be long then she went to the slave girls and unbinding them said to them in the tongue of greece get ye to some safe place till i foil this moslem s lust and longing for you so they went away whilst sharrkan kept gazing at them and they kept turning to look at the two then each approached the adversary and he set his breast against hers but when he felt waist touch waist his strength failed him and she waxing ware of this lifted him with her hands swiftlier than the blinding leven flash and threw him to the ground he fell on his back fn and then she said to him rise i give thee thy life a second time i spared thee in the first count because of thy prophet for that he made unlawful the slaying of women and i do so on the second count because of thy weakliness and the greenness of thine years and thy strangerhood but i charge thee if there be in the moslem army sent by omar bin al nu uman to succour the king of constantinople a stronger than thou send him hither and tell him of me for in wrestling there are shifts and trips catches and holds such as the feint or falsing and the snap or first grip the hug the feet catch the thigh lite fn the jostle and the leg lock by allah o my lady quoth sharrkan and indeed he was highly incensed against her had i been master al safd master mohammed kim l or ibn al sadd fn as they were in their prime i had kept no note of these shifts thou mentionest for o my mistress by allah thou hast not grassed me by thy strength but by the blandishments of thy back parts for we men of mesopotamia so love a full formed thigh that nor sense was left me nor foresight but now an thou wish thou shalt try a third fall with me while my wits are about me and this last match is allowed me by the laws of the game which sayeth the best of three moreover i have regained my presence of mind when she heard his words she said to him hast thou not had a belly full of this wrestling o vanquished one however come on an thou wilt but know that this must be the last round then she bent forward and challenged him and sharrkan did likewise setting to it in real earnest and being right cautious about the throw so the two strove awhile and the damsel found in him a strength such as she had not observed before and said to him o moslem thou art now on thy mettle yes he replied thou knowest that there remaineth to me but this one round after which each of us will wend a different way she laughed and he laughed too fn then she overreached at his thigh and caught firm hold of it unawares which made him greet the ground and fall full on his back she laughed at him and said art thou an eater of bran thou are like a badawi s bonnet which falleth off with every touch or else the father of winds fn that droppeth before a puff of air fie upon thee o thou poor thing adding get thee back to the moslem army and send us ot,"['flow', 'nurse', 'trust', 'offspring', 'slave',

manifesto of the communist party in german radical workers living in paris formed a secret association called league of the just at congresses in london in it changed its name to communist league and commissioned marx and engels who had recently become members to draw up a manifesto on its behalf both men prepared first drafts engels draft preserved under the title the principles of communism was in the form of a catechism with twenty five questions and answers marx is believed to have had the greater hand in giving the communist manifesto its final form as both a programmatic statement and a compressed summary of the marxian theory of history it was originally published in london in february and brought out in a french translation in paris shortly before the insurrection of june there it has become the most widely read and influential single document of modern socialism the text given here is that of the english edition of edited by engels preface to the german edition of the communist league an international association of workers which could of course be only a secret one under the conditions obtaining at the time commissioned the undersigned at the congress held in london in november to draw up for publication a detailed theoretical and practical programme of the party such was the origin of the following manifesto the manuscript of which traveled to london to be printed a few weeks before the february revolution first published in german it has been republished in that language in at least twelve different editions in germany england and america it was published in english for the first time in in the red republican london translated by miss helen macfarlane and in in at least three different translations in america a french version first appeared in paris shortly before the june insurrection of and recently in le socialiste of new york a new translation is in the course of preparation a polish version appeared in london shortly after it was first published in german a russian translation was published in geneva in the sixties into danish too it was translated shortly after its first appearance however much the state of things may have altered during the last twenty five years the general principles laid down in this manifesto are on the w hole as correct today as ever here and there some detail might be improved the practical application of the principles will depend as the manifesto itself states everywhere and at all times on the historical conditions for the time being existing and for that reason no special stress is laid on the revolutionary measures proposed at the end of section ii that passage would in many respects be very differently worded today in view of the gigantic strides of modern industry in the last twenty five years and of the accompanying improved and extended party organization of the working class in view of the practical experience gained first in the february revolution and then still more in the paris commune where the proletariat for the first time held political power for two whole months this programme has in some details become antiquated one thing especially was proved by the commune viz that the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready made state machinery and wield it for its own purposes see the civil war in france address of the general council of the international working men s association london trulove p where this point is further developed further it is self evident that the criticism of socialist literature is deficient in relation to the present time because it comes down only to also that the remarks on t h e relation of the communists to the various opposition parties section iv although in principle still correct yet in practice are antiquated because the political situation has been entirely changed and the progress of history has swept from off the earth the greater portion of the political parties there enumerated but then the manifesto has become a historical document which we have no longer any right to alter a subsequent edition may perhaps appear with an introduction bridging the gap from to the present day this reprint was too unexpected to leave us time for that london june preface to the russian edition of the first russian edition of the manifesto of the communist party translated by bakunin was published early in the sixties by the printing office of the kolokol then the west could see in it the russian edition of the manifesto only a literary curiosity such a view would be impossible today what a limited field the proletarian movement still occupied at that time december is most clearly shown by the last section of the manifesto the position of the communists in relation to the various opposition parties in the various countries precisely russia and the united states are missing here it was the time when russia constituted the last great reserve of all european reaction when the united states absorbed the surplus proletarian forces of europe through immigration both countries provided europe with raw materials and were at the same time markets for the sale of its industrial products at that time both were therefore in one way or another pillars of the existing european order how very different today precisely european immigration fitted north america for a gigantic agricultural production whose competition is shaking the very foundations of european landed property large and small in addition it enabled the united states to exploit its tremendous industrial resources with an energy and on a scale that must shortly break the industrial monopoly of western europe and especially of england existing up to now both circumstances react in revolutionary manner upon america itself step by step the small and middle landownership of the farmers the basis of the whole political constitution is succumbing to the competition of giant farms simultaneously a mass proletariat and a fabulous concentration of capitals are developing for the first time in the industrial regions and now russia during the revolution of not only the european princes but the european bourgeois as well found their only salvation from the proletariat just beginning to awaken in russian intervention the tsar was proclaimed the chief of european reaction today he is a prisoner of war of the revolution in gatchina and russia forms the vanguard of revolutionary action in europe the communist manifesto had as its object the proclamation of the inevitably imp ending dissolution of modern bourgeois property but in russia we find face to face with the rapidly developing capitalist swindle and bourgeois landed property just beginning to develop more than half the land owned in common by the peasants now the question is can the russian obshchina though greatly undermined yet a form of the primeval common ownership of land pass directly to the higher form of communist common ownership or on the contrary must it first pass through the same process of dissolution as constitutes the historical evolution of the west the only answer to that possible today is this if the russian revolution becomes the signal for a proletarian revolution in the west so that both complement each other the present russian common ownership of land may serve as the starting point for a communist development london january preface to the german edition of the preface to the present edition i must alas sign alone marx the man to whom the whole working class of europe and america owes more than to anyone else rests at highgate cemetery and over his grave the first grass is already growing since his death there can be even less thought of revising or supplementing the manifesto all the more do i consider it necessary again to state here the following expressly the basic thought running through the manifesto that economic production and the structure of society of every historical epoch necessarily arising there from constitute the foundation for the political and intellectual history of that epoch that consequently ever since the dissolution of the primeval communal ownership of land all history has been a history of class struggles of struggles between exploited and exploiting between dominated and dominating classes at various stages of social development that this struggle however has now reached a stage where the exploited and oppressed class the proletariat can no longer emancipate itself from the class which exploits and oppresses it the bourgeoisie without at the same time forever freeing the whole of society from exploitation oppression and class struggles this basic thought belongs solely and exclusively to marx i have already stated this many times but precisely now it is necessary that it also stand in front of the manifesto itself london june manifesto of the community party a spectre is haunting europe the spectre of communism all the powers of old europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre pope and czar metternich and guizot french radicals and german police spies where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power where the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism against the more advanced opposition parties as well as against its reactionary adversaries two things result from this fact i communism is already acknowledged by all european powers to be itself a power ii it is high time that communists should openly in the face of the whole world publish their views their aims their tendencies and meet this nursery tale of the spectre of communism with a manifesto of the party itself to this end communists of various nationalities have assembled in london and sketched the following manifesto to be published in the english french german italian flemish and danish languages i bourgeois and proletarians the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles freeman and slave patrician and plebeian lord and serf guild master and journeyman in a word oppressor and oppressed stood in constant opposition to one another carried on an uninterrupted now hidden now open fight a fight that each time ended either in a revolutionary re constitution of society at large or in the common ruin of the contending classes in the earlier epochs of history we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders a manifold gradation of social rank in ancient rome we have patricians knights plebeians slaves in the middle ages feudal lords vassals guild masters journeymen apprentices serfs in almost all of these classes again subordinate gradations the modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with clash antagonisms it has but established new classes new conditions of oppression new forms of struggle in place of the old ones our epoch the epoch of the bourgeoisie possesses however this distinctive feature it has simplified the class antagonisms society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps into two great classes directly facing each other bourgeoisie and proletariat from the serfs of the middle ages sprang the chartered burghers of the earliest towns from these burgesses the first elements of the bourgeoisie were developed the discovery of america the rounding of the cape opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie the east indian and chinese markets the colonisation of america trade with the colonies the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally gave to commerce to navigation to industry an impulse never before known and thereby to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society a rapid development the feudal system of industry under which industrial production was monopolised by closed guilds now no longer sufficed for the growing wants of the new markets the manufacturing system took its place the guild masters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle class division of labour between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of labour in each single workshop meantime the markets kept ever growing the demand ever rising even manufacture no longer sufficed thereupon steam and machinery revolutionised industrial production the place of manufacture was taken by the giant modern industry the place of the industrial middle class by industrial millionaires the leaders of whole industrial armies the modern bourgeois modern industry has established the world market for which the discovery of america paved the way this market has given an immense development to commerce to navigation to communication by land this development has in its turn reacted on the extension of industry and in proportion as industry commerce navigation railways extended in the same proportion the bourgeoisie developed increased its capital and pushed into the background every class handed down from the middle ages we see therefore how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of a long course of development of a series of revolutions in the modes of production and of exchange each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political advance of that class an oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility an armed and self governing association in the medieval commune here independent urban republic as in italy and germany there taxable third estate of the monarchy as in france afterwards in the period of manufacture proper serving either the semi feudal or the absolute monarchy as a counterpoise against the nobility and in fact corner stone of the great monarchies in general the bourgeoisie has at last since the establishment of modern industry and of the world market conquered for itself in the modern representative state exclusive political sway the executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie the bourgeoisie historically has played a most revolutionary part the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his natural superiors and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploitation the bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe it has converted the physician the lawyer the priest the poet the man of science into its paid wage labourers the bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation the bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of vigour in the middle ages which reactionists so much admire found its fitting complement in the most slothful indolence it has been the first to show what man s activity can bring about it has accomplished wonders far surpassing egyptian pyramids roman aqueducts and gothic cathedrals it has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former exoduses of nations and crusades the bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production and thereby the relations of production and with them the whole relations of society conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form was on the contrary the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes constant revolutionising of production uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones all fixed fast frozen relations with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions are swept away all new formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify all that is solid melts into air all that is holy is profaned and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life and his relations with his kind the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe it must nestle everywhere settle everywhere establish connections everywhere the bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world market given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country to the great chagrin of reactionists it has drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood all old established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed they are dislodged by new industries whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilized nations by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal inter dependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature the bourgeoisie by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production by the immensely facilitated means of communication draws all even the most barbarian nations into civilisation the cheap prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all chinese walls with which it forces the barbarians intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate it compels all nations on pain of extinction to adopt the bourgeois mode of production it compels them to introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst i e to become bourgeois themselves in one word it creates a world after its own image the bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns it has created enormous cities has greatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural and has thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life just as it has made the country dependent on the towns so it has made barbarian and semi barbarian countries dependent on the civilized ones nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois the east on the west the bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population of the means of production and of property it has agglomerated population centralised means of production and has concentrated property in a few hands the necessary consequence of this was political centralisation independent or but loosely connected provinces with separate interests laws governments and systems of taxation became lumped together into one nation with one government one code of laws one national class interest one frontier and one customs tariff the bourgeoisie during its rule of scarce one hundred years has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together subjection of nature s forces to man machinery application of chemistry to industry and agriculture steam navigation railways electric telegraphs clearing of whole continents for cultivation canalisation of rivers whole populations conjured out of the ground what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labour we see then the means of production and of exchange on whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up were generated in feudal society at a certain stage in the development of these means of production and of exchange the conditions under which feudal society produced and exchanged the feudal organisation of agriculture and manufacturing industry in one word the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already developed productive forces they became so many fetters they had to be burst asunder they were burst asunder into their place stepped free competition accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted to it and by the economical and political sway of the bourgeois class a similar movement is going on before our own eyes modern bourgeois society with its relations of production of exchange and of property a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells for many a decade past the history of industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of modern productive forces against modern conditions of production against the property relations that are the conditions for the existence of the bourgeoisie and of i its rule it is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put on its trial each time more threateningly the existence of the entire bourgeois society in these crises a great p art not only of the existing products but also of the previously created productive forces are periodically destroyed in these crises there breaks out an epidemic that in all earlier epochs would have seemed an absurdity the epidemic of over production society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism it appears as if a famine a universal war of devastation had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence industry and commerce seem to be destroyed and why because there is too much civilisation too much means of subsistence too much industry too much commerce the productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property on the contrary they have become too powerful for these conditions by which they are fettered and so soon as they overcome these fetters they bring disorder into the whole of bourgeois society endanger the existence of bourgeois property the conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them and how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises on the one hand by enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces on the other by the conquest of new markets and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones that is to say by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented the weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself but not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons the modern working class the proletarians in proportion as the bourgeoisie i e capital is developed in the same proportion is the proletariat the modern working class developed a class of labourers who live only so long as they find work and who find work only so long as their labour increases capital these labourers who must sell themselves piece meal are a commodity like every other article of commerce and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition to all the fluctuations of the market owing to the extensive use of machinery and to division of labour the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character and consequently all charm for the workman he becomes an appendage of the machine and it is only the most simple most monotonous and most easily acquired knack that is required of him hence the cost of production of a workman is restricted almost entirely to the means of subsistence that he requires for his maintenance and for the propagation of his race but the price of a commodity and therefore also of labour is equal to its cost of production in proportion therefore as the repulsiveness of the work increases the wage decreases nay more in proportion as the use of machinery and division of labour increases in the same proportion the burden of toil also increases whether by prolongation of the working hours by increase of the work exacted in a given time or by increased speed of the machinery etc modern industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist masses of labourers crowded into the factory are organised like soldiers as privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class and of the bourgeois state they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine by the over looker and above all by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself the more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim the more petty the more hateful and the more embittering it is the less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual labour in other words the more modern industry becomes developed the more is the labour of men superseded by that of women differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working class all are instruments of labour more or less expensive to use according to their age and sex no sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer so far at an end that he receives his wages in cash than he is set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie the landlord the shopkeeper the pawnbroker etc the lower strata of the middle class the small tradespeople shopkeepers and retired tradesmen generally the handicraftsmen and peasants all these sink gradually into the proletariat partly because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which modern industry is carried on and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists partly because their specialized skill is rendered worthless by new methods of production thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the population the proletariat goes through various stages of development with its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie at first the contest is carried on by individual labourers then by the work people of a factory then by the operatives of one trade in one locality against the individual bourgeois who directly exploits them they direct their attacks not against the bourgeois conditions of production but against the instruments of production themselves they destroy imported wares that compete with their labour they smash to pieces machinery they set factories ablaze they seek to restore by force the vanished status of the workman of the middle ages at this stage the labourers still form an incoherent mass scattered over the whole country and broken up by their mutual competition if anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies this is not yet the consequence of their own active union but of the union of the bourgeoisie which class in order to attain its own political ends is compelled to set the whole proletariat in motion and is moreover yet for a time able to do so at this stage therefore the proletarians do not fight their enemies but the enemies of their enemies the remnants of absolute monarchy the landowners the non industrial bourgeois the petty bourgeoisie thus the whole historical movement is concentrated in the hands of the bourgeoisie every victory so obtained is a victory for the bourgeoisie but with the development of industry the proletariat not only increases in number it becomes concentrated in greater masses its strength grows and it feels that strength more the various interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat are more and more equalised in proportion as machinery obliterates all distinctions of labour and nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level the growing competition among the bourgeois and the resulting commercial crises make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating the unceasing improvement of machinery ever more rapidly developing makes their livelihood more and more precarious the collisions between individual workmen and individual bourgeois take more and more the character of collisions between two classes thereupon the workers begin to form combinations trades unions against the bourgeois they club together in order to keep up the rate of wages they found permanent associations in order to make provision beforehand for these occasional revolts here and there the contest breaks out into riots now and then the workers are victorious but only for at time the real fruit of their battles lies not in the immediate result but in the ever expanding union of the workers this union is helped on by the improved means of communication that are created by modern industry and that place the workers of different localities in contact with one another it was j us t this contact that was needed to centralise the numerous local struggles all of the same character into one national struggle between classes but every class struggle is a political struggle and that union to attain which the burghers of the middle ages with their miserable highways required centuries the modern proletarians thanks to railways achieve in a few years this organisation of the proletarians into a class and consequently in to a political party is continually being upset again by the competition between the workers themselves but it ever rises up again stronger firmer mightier it compels legislative recognition of particular interests of the workers by taking advantage of the divisions among the bourgeoisie itself thus the ten hours bill in england was carried altogether collisions between the classes of the old society further in many ways the course of development of the proletariat the bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant battle at first with the aristocracy later on with those portions of the bourgeoisie itself whose interests have become antagonistic to the progress of industry at all times with the bourgeoisie of foreign countries in all these battles i t sees itself compelled to appeal to the proletariat to ask for its help and thus to drag it into the political arena the bourgeoisie itself therefore supplies the proletariat with its own elements of political and general education in other words it furnishes the proletariat with weapons for fighting the bourgeoisie further as we have already seen entire sections of the ruling classes are by the advance of industry precipitated into the proletariat or are at least threatened in their conditions of existence these also supply the proletariat with fresh elements of enlightenment and progress finally in times when the class struggle nears the decisive hour the process of dissolution going on within the ruling class in fact within the whole range of society assumes such a violent glaring character that a small section of the ruling class cuts itself adrift and joins the revolutionary class the class that holds the future in its hands just as therefore at an earlier period a section of the nobility went over to the bourgeoisie so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the proletariat and in particular a portion of the bourgeois ideologists who have raised themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically the historical movement as a whole of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class the other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of modern industry the proletariat is its special and essential product the lower middle class the small manufacturer the shopkeeper the artisan the peasant all these fight against the bourgeoisie to save from extinction their existence as fractions of the middle class they are therefore not revolutionary but conservative nay more they are reactionary for they try to roll back the wheel o f history if by chance they are revolutionary they are so only in view of their impending transfer into the proletariat they thus defend not their present but their future interests they desert their own standpoint to place t,"['forever', 'slave', 'display', 'powerful', 'absolute', 'secret', 'race', 'summary', 'sufficiency', 'masse',

fuck it i m back too what s up premier battles you already know the dizzle been underground now shuff s back in town lock up your daughters josef fritzl but this battle was meant to be last april honestly he called it off i m like what but mate you promised me i asked if it s still happening he s like maybe possibly i ve been patiently waiting for this ancient prophesy too pussy to actually face me properly he s pissing himself worried that he ll take a loss to me colostomy it s taken you three prime ministers and a change of monarchy do you understand how many lines i wrote that are now outdated due to your attitude do you understand how many will smith chris rock punchlines i had to scrap for you and organizing an event and putting yourself as the headline is the worst mate it smacks of those kids who charged the other kids to come to their birthday we re having this clash judged too by performers he would have to know because they rap for your platform this sports arena that you own i can only imagine which way they all will see the battle go this is about as unbiased as kim jong un in a north korean talent show i ve also seen your battles though i ve got you figured out roids simmer down mate you should be chilling out poised think about it all he has is a loud voice but your writing s more of a shits how than mrs brown s boys you hit mid thirties and went up about six dress sizes you are a limping groaning knuckle dragging midlife crisis i don t care who s most popular i care about who s the nicest you have a bigger name than me so does fucking isis now i preferred you when you were off the roids and thin but now he s addicted to working out and it s poisoned him you on social media is an extremely annoying thing my whole twitter feed is you and cojay just agreeing you enjoy the gym i want the stick person that we ve seen this version baffles me wants to wrestle now well i doubt we ll see a big surge in casualties such a fake guy he ll only fake fight he ll inverse to atrophy want to wrestle so bad go wrestle with your split personality i m praying and i am hoping that by the end of this his head is fixed i m talking to him since it s clear a therapist never did cause you on social media is nuts i mean you ve got this anger that brews there s different versions of him these doppelg ngers you use someone says something you don t like he s gotten mad in a mood now shotty s back in the room you re not the adam we knew this constant angst is problematic what s the matter drop the act this rotten apple s gotten bad he s lost and tangled shocking tact you re not a man you re a youth that s not what adults should do acting like everyone s against him what an arrogant view like you re the center of attention your logic has to improve not everybody s a snake a shocking fact but it s true when you fall out with everyone then the common factor is you you fuck up relationships the moment you activate a computer turning friends you keep into enemies and those actions make you a user think st patrick s day i banish snakes i am the saint of the future i keep ahead a head of serpents like perseus decapitating medusa so don t let his bullshit blur your vision don t be intimidated by a word he s written cause what he writes isn t true like tabloid journalism so don t be scared most horroh s horror stories are a work of fiction you might also like round shotty horroh he s alright isn t he probably someone with a case for the top not many can joke as good as him you normally know i m goin to win but today you aren t sure that

can t downplay him fuck shuffle t i ve been talkin smokin loud statements dj with the drop on him shuffle on the floor like house ravers you rhyme words together really well that s why the people love you but that s just one piece of the secret puzzle that s like missin the sea cause you see the puddle that s where you seem to struggle you perform like your knees were buckled if you even push up a feeble muscle you let him do this with no conviction just like if someone looks like him finds himself in legal trouble he stays insecure stood on the spot lookin like he needs a cuddle as he speaks so discrete and subtle that s why we don t believe in ya so many elite mc s that leagues above ya we don t in shuffle like the deal s a hustle you get it but that ain t the gamblin part i told briggzy we re gonna need a proper shuffle or it s gonna damage the card you think pretending to not have an ego is the cheat code like it s an invincible spell he thinks that if any mc is givin him hell he just needs to giggle as well and it isn t an l all that nonchalant shit of you bein the biggest you could be if you don t believe it we don t believe it as well i mean all that self deprecating only made you be little belittle yourself second round in safe star bless only one more round and plenty more space in that graveyard left round shuffle t shuffle pulls out his phone hey yeah um can i speak to someone in hr yeah it s to deal with well being and safeguards is the number on my name card my place of work is shotty horroh s graveyard my complaints are i never get told when a new shipment of bodies is coming in which is a great start i just have to wait for them to magically pop up on my radar and i think he s in denial cause i know where the graves are and he always saying that he isn t but he is running out of space fast if we ask too many questions he forces us out he turns up some days and orders us round he was meant to be in for a meeting at a quarter to now some are saying he won t show up that s what people are saying it s a hassle it s a stress it s havoc it s a mess i just get batches of the dead turn up through national express and if i ask how they died that s a sackable offence am i to believe that he what rap battles them to death i m calling today cause i ve just had someone through tali another hopeless victim and i m looking around and i ve got no idea for the life of me where i m s posed to fit him plot no that s taken it s taken it don t need filling well i can put tali in there but he s going to have tony with him i get that these things are best handled with stealth it s just it s extra stress for me which is bad for my health but i guess i ve just got to deal with the hand i was dealt what was your name alright briggzy well thanks for your help listen i m glad he s laughin cause usually he s terrifying when he does smile his face id doesn t recognize him that and you ve put on a amount of weight a bit of padding around the face you re the man of the house it s great i bet your calorie count s insane but i m not intimidated by you that wasn t how i was raised i don t feel fear next to you i just feel massively out of shape now he did beat me in that film vs but it was hard for me to lose that cause i first wrote my side of the battle they said we can t really use that it needs to be worse than shotty s material so can you write us a new rap i said worse than shotty s stuff i don t know if i can do that in the end i had to go through about scripts to make my stuff as bad as what s coming out that fucking mouth of his at one point i just screwed up a piece of paper and rubbed it round in shit the director said i think we ll need to dumb it down a bit i was in mile as well you seen it ahh it s genius as fuck producer called me personally said we need you for this shuff i was meant to lose to eminem but the scenes have all been cut apparently me getting beat wasn t believable enough now listen me and funny go together like bees and honey easy money heretic and a vegan curry but it s an understatement if you re describing me as hungry that s like calling ian huntley a cheeky monkey i feel so comfy up here i m winning this in every round i should be getting out my armchair slippers and a dressing gown you should bring briggzy in as well man fuck it just for a laugh we can turn this in to a v and a half cause look at all the people that you have to bring with you the second that a battle s not inside of the m i could ve had this battle in your house in your parent s living room and have them both arguing over who they d give it to your mom gives it to me so if i were you i would honestly hide in a safe space because this could cost you your life and that is fucking mate s rates i am in here to have a couple of quick beers and slay i don t care if the sharks or the knights are the ones that win here today don t get that misconstrued i mean my win s clear on stage i just don t care about the teams cause i m not years of age every performance i have out of i give myself a million i am my own worst critic and i think i m fucking brilliant so fuck it the round s done i got his back to the turnbuckle let s all see how many puns this cunt has for the word shuffle time round shotty horroh i mean shuffle t s funny as fuck i ve been quotin him when he s roastin them as far as the stand up comedy rap battle fans go it s either o shea or him to be the goat for them but there s this joe pesci notion funny how if you focusin cause there s two types of funny in this world bro and you re both of em cause you re funny like you re funny when they re lovin your clowin but you re funny like there s really somethin funny about him cause i don t fuck my friends over you get bad luck from it pussy try bein a stand up guy before you try bein a stand up comic cause no matter what cruger and bags do for this lad you know he s team rowan forever he literally robbed your friends of their business pursuit as he dm d you you instantly fold to the pressure he s payin you with the money that he owes to them don t act like you didn t know any better crazy that you made a paperback when you was the staple that didn t have the spine to hold it together he does not give a fuck i ve never met anybody as bold as he is can you imagine him cruger and bagnall on zoom if they host a meetin for the sound like show that evenin and he s tangent off to don t flop the whole case the whole proceedings he sat there like what a cunt what a cunt sorry guys that s my phone hello roooooo hello ronan keating boys i have ronan keating he does not give a fuck you have to understand that shit he did with liam and freddie that shit made em sick they ain t just anybodys without them i don t think the scene you see today exists i m not saying you re a piece of shit cause you didn t hold it down i m just sayin you ain t legit cause he tried doin the same shit to my brother and we squaded up and created this loyal to the soil i don t fuck with anybody that wants to play with briggz you don t like him i don t you simple plain as shit that s why our careers meet at a fork in the road and they separate like this cause you re still maintainin a main event career and gettin a wage from it and i m the guy that pays you it and i did your little panel show for free twice it was covid times i let the love persuade me you couldn t sell tickets make money there was no crowd stuff was crazy you came at me with the whole we re friends angle and i cause me charging shuffle shady until we needed you during the pandemic and your attitude was fuck you pay me so fuck shuffle t and his book and his infiltrating gentrification in a class these posh cunts can t see what the streets created with the scraps and wanna turn it into data and a click this link and learn how to be hip hop fuck off we ain t got the patience for all a dat for your book to be useful to me i d have to tape it to my abs so i was safe from gettin stabbed i didn t learn this shift from a fuckin book i was battlin on the street corner since i had a bus pass and pocket full of dust caps people hated fuck that i handled the positive and the negative like a blood bank me versus you on ain t a good match cause i ve always been a couple points above you like a umlaut next thing i wanna talk about is very fuckin serious it s not a joke cause i don t trust a man who s arms don t move when he walks it s one of those why do your arms look so heavy bro i gotta know you look like every single trying to carry your mum s worth of shopping home fuckin strange guy lookin like the little men in black alien inside him can t operate the arms and the legs at the same time and thank you very much another straight white male with a podcast with long hair and edgy jokes it s fuckin russel off brand that s me thank you round shuffle t now your music has actually been a little different lately when you up and switch so fucking quick it comes across as shady that scum of the earth album was so oasis influenced it was crazy i said do you think you might have ripped them off a bit he said mayyyyyybeeeeeeee i said yeah definitely maybe here s what i think happened i think you started copying them little by little then you just roll with it head up in the clouds i mean he doesn t hear it it makes him wonder what all wonderwall the fuss is about no one s more pissed off than me i liked how your old albums sound in fact i don t believe that anybody feels the way i do about you now don t look back in anger you blended brit pop and hip hop with rock thought it would be shit hot big shock it s not you ripped off a band you like and yeah you did it beautifully but musically now you re nowhere near as good as it used to be cause when you sell out your art for a dime it ll never be far from your mind cause when you ve been cast to the side those steps are a bastard to climb you re energy starved and you ll try but never regrasp on those heights your penmanship starts to decline your presence your bars and your lines and everything s harder to rhyme integrity s hard to define but when you pretend to be part of a life of the celebrity s art that you like all you re doing is karaoke you dress up you dance and you mime so all you ve actually done is perfected the art of disguise that s why you re running out of smoke like a contestant on stars in their eyes tonight matthew i m going to shove noel s gallagher s dick in every hole that it can fit the only role that you can give this ain t a cold slap on the wrist you re facing the whole character list of soul caliber that s why he s saying shit lines these days like it tali and italian blood run in the streets oh my god you re such a prick the manny crowd were loving it most people wouldn t fuck with it i was just watching with a confused face i couldn t keep up with it not because it s too complex just cause it s fucking shit italian blood running the streets i ll slow down i m out maneuvering i m gettin a bit too complex so let me do some tutoring see i said something about the mafia but i included in his pseudonym i don t give a shit if you crammed his name in there it still has fuck all to do with him let me say something simple and make it official battle rap bars aren t personal cause their name or initial was placed in the middle every round from you these days is just this crazy horrid scheme you make it sound complex but it s always just the same obnoxious theme people used to be able to battle in a way they d want to speak whatever happened to just fucking saying what you mean every line it s i said one thing that sounds like another thing isn t that clever i m just watching from the side like mate it isn t that clever so i won t dress this up with word play i ll just tell you what the truth is i think insecurity is the reason you became a unit your battles aren t that great these days neither is your music i think you re overrated and i think you re fuckin stupid this is loud mouth bullshit versus strong and silent you make something simple feel like rocket science i make rocket science feel like comic timing like hugh laurie the two ronnies or monty python it doesn t make an ounce of difference how you spin it which way round you flip it upside down and twisted i am bound to win this and the crowd can witness this counterfeited coward s limits there s always praise for you and you re showered with it put on a pedestal like some proud exhibit they put you in the top they ve mapped out your image well you can have mount rushmore i ll take mount olympus you say i m a clown as if it means that i m annoyed i love that reputation that s my pride and joy so go find some roids alright enjoy take that belt to its biting point i ll just kick you in the bollocks with my clown shoes so hard you ll have a higher voice than a choirboy s if you re watching from overseas watch more uk battle rap watch frankie frost oshea cojay gemini it s action packed watch premier battles don t flop no loose chat fuck it watch some danny jaqq just stop giving all your attention to this overrated fuckin twat see i beat you with word play angles aggression concepts this battle s what i make it you just forever rely on americanized generically rhymed name flips you re an imitator you see what s out there and you claim it i m an innovator i see what s out there and i change it timeembed,"['forever', 'trust', 'brown', 'drop', 'laugh', 'pun', 'traction', 'versus', 'fan', 'maneuver', 'secret', 'note',

,spotify:track:0bYbFvmCkyzay5G4zDvSeV,lord of the flies chap huts on the beach lyricschapter three huts on the beach jack was bent double he was down like a sprinter his nose only a few inches from the humid earth the tree trunks and the creepers that festooned them lost themselves in a green dusk thirty feet above him and all about was the undergrowth there was only the faintest indication of a trail here a cracked twig and what might be the impression of one side of a hoof he lowered his chin and stared at the traces as though he would force them to speak to him then dog like uncomfortably on all fours yet unheeding his discomfort he stole forward five yards and stopped here was loop of creeper with a tendril pendant from a node the tendril was polished on the underside pigs passing through the loop brushed it with their bristly hide jack crouched with his face a few inches away from this clue then stared forward into the semi darkness of the undergrowth his sandy hair considerably longer than it had been when they dropped in was lighter now and his bare back was a mass of dark freckles and peeling sunburn a sharpened stick about five feet long trailed from his right hand and except for a pair of tattered shorts held up by his knife belt he was naked he closed his eyes raised his head and breathed in gently with flared nostrils assessing the current of warm air for information the forest and he were very still at length he let out his breath in a long sigh and opened his eyes they were bright blue eyes that in this frustration seemed bolting and nearly mad he passed his tongue across dry lips and scanned the uncommunicative forest then again he stole forward and cast this way and that over the ground the silence of the forest was more oppressive than the heat and at this hour of the day there was not even the whine of insects only when jack himself roused a gaudy bird from a primitive nest of sticks was the silence shattered and echoes set ringing by a harsh cry that seemed to come out of the abyss of ages jack himself shrank at this cry with a hiss of indrawn breath and for a minute became less a hunter than a furtive thing ape like among the tangle of trees then the trail the frustration claimed him again and he searched the ground avidly by the trunk of a vast tree that grew pale flowers on its grey bark he checked closed his eyes and once more drew in the warm air and this time his breath came short there was even a passing pallor in his face and then the surge of blood again he passed like a shadow under the darkness of the tree and crouched looking down at the trodden ground at his feet the droppings were warm they lay piled among turned earth they were olive green smooth and they steamed a little jack lifted his head and stared at the inscrutable masses of creeper that lay across the trail then he raised his spear and sneaked forward beyond the creeper the trail joined a pig run that was wide enough and trodden enough to be a path the ground was hardened by an accustomed tread and as jack rose to his full height he heard something moving on it he swung back his right arm and hurled the spear with all his strength from the pig run came the quick hard patter of hoofs a castanet sound seductive maddening the promise of meat he rushed out of the undergrowth and snatched up his spear the pattering of pig s trotters died away in the distance jack stood there streaming with sweat streaked with brown earth stained by all the vicissitudes of a day s hunting swearing he turned off the trail and pushed his way through until the forest opened a little and instead of bald trunks supporting a dark roof there were light grey trunks and crowns of feathery palm beyond these was the glitter of the sea and he could hear voices ralph was standing by a contraption of palm trunks and leaves a rude shelter that faced the lagoon and seemed very near to falling down he did not notice when jack spoke got any water ralph looked up frowning from the complication of leaves he did not notice jack even when he saw him i said have you got any water i m thirsty ralph withdrew his attention from the shelter and realized jack with a start oh hullo water there by the tree ought to be some left jack took up a coconut shell that brimmed with fresh water from among a group that was arranged in the shade and drank the water splashed over his chin and neck and chest he breathed noisily when he had finished needed that simon spoke from inside the shelter up a bit ralph turned to the shelter and lifted a branch with a whole tiling of leaves the leaves came apart and fluttered down simon s contrite face appeared in the hole sorry ralph surveyed the wreck with distaste never get it done he flung himself down at jack s feet simon remained looking out of the hole in the shelter once down ralph explained been working for days now and look two shelters were in position but shaky this one was a ruin and they keep running off you remember the meeting how everyone was going to work hard until the shelters were finished except me and my hunters except the hunters well the littluns are he gesticulated sought for a word they re hopeless the older ones aren t much better d you see all day i ve been working with simon no one else they re off bathing or eating or playing simon poked his head out carefully you re chief you tell em off ralph lay flat and looked up at the palm trees and the sky meetings don t we love meetings every day twice a day we talk he got on one elbow i bet if i blew the conch this minute they d come running then we d be you know very solemn and someone would say we ought to build a jet or a submarine or a tv set when the meeting was over they d work for five minutes then wander off or go hunting jack flushed we want meat well we haven t got any yet and we want shelters besides the rest of your hunters came back hours ago they ve been swimming i went on said jack i let them go i had to go on i he tried to convey the compulsion to track down and kill that was swallowing him up i went on i thought by myself the madness came into his eyes again i thought i might kill but you didn t i thought i might some hidden passion vibrated in ralph s voice but you haven t yet his invitation might have passed as casual were it not for the undertone you wouldn t care to help with the shelters i suppose we want meat and we don t get it now the antagonism was audible but i shall next time i ve got to get a barb on this spear we wounded a pig and the spear fell out if we could only make barbs we need shelters suddenly jack shouted in rage are you accusing all i m saying is we ve worked dashed hard that s all they were both red in the face and found looking at each other difficult ralph rolled on his stomach and began to play with the grass if it rains like when we dropped in we ll need shelters all right and then another thing we need shelters because of the he paused for a moment and they both pushed their anger away then he went on with the safe changed subject you ve noticed haven t you jack put down his spear and squatted noticed what well they re frightened he rolled over and peered into jack s fierce dirty face i mean the way things are they dream you can hear em have you been awake at night jack shook his head they talk and scream the littluns even some of the others as if as if it wasn t a good island astonished at the interruption they looked up at simon s serious face as if said simon the beastie the beastie or the snake thing was real remember the two older boys flinched when they heard the shameful syllable snakes were not mentioned now were not mentionable as if this wasn t a good island said ralph slowly yes that s right jack sat up and stretched out his legs crackers remember when we went exploring they grinned at each other remembering the glamour of the first day ralph went on so we need shelters as a sort of home that s right jack drew up his legs clasped his knees and frowned in an effort to attain clarity all the same in the forest i mean when you re hunting not when you re getting fruit of course but when you re on your own he paused for a moment not sure if ralph would take him seriously go on if you re hunting sometimes you catch yourself feeling as if he flushed suddenly there s nothing in it of course just a feeling but you can feel as if you re not hunting but being hunted as if something s behind you all the time in the jungle they were silent again simon intent ralph incredulous and faintly indignant he sat up rubbing one shoulder with a dirty hand well i don t know jack leapt to his feet and spoke very quickly that s how you can feel in the forest of course there s nothing in it only only he took a few rapid steps toward the beach then came back only i know how they feel see that s all the best thing we can do is get ourselves rescued jack had to think for a moment before he could remember what rescue was rescue yes of course all the same i d like to catch a pig first he snatched up his spear and dashed it into the ground the opaque mad look came into his eyes again ralph looked at him critically through his tangle of fair hair so long as your hunters remember the fire you and your fire the two boys trotted down the beach and turning at the water s edge looked back at the pink mountain the trickle of smoke sketched a chalky line up the solid blue of the sky wavered high up and faded ralph frowned i wonder how far off you could see that miles we don t make enough smoke the bottom part of the trickle as though conscious of their gaze thickened to a creamy blur which crept up the feeble column they ve put on green branches muttered ralph i wonder he screwed up his eyes and swung round to search the horizon got it jack shouted so loudly that ralph jumped what where is it a ship but jack was pointing to the high declivities that led down from the mountain to the flatter part of the island of course they ll be up there they must when the sun s too hot ralph gazed bewildered at his rapt face they get up high high up and in the shade resting during the heat like cows at home i thought you saw a ship we could steal up on one paint our faces so they wouldn t see perhaps surround them and then indignation took away ralph s control i was talking about smoke don t you want to be rescued all you can talk about is pig pig pig but we want meat and i work all day with nothing but simon and you come back and don t even notice the huts i was working too but you like it shouted ralph you want to hunt while i they faced each other on the bright beach astonished at the rub of feeling ralph looked away first pretending interest in a group of littluns on the sand from beyond the platform came the shouting of the hunters in the swimming pool on the end of the platform piggy was lying flat looking down into the brilliant water people don t help much he wanted to explain how people were never quite what you thought they were simon he helps he pointed at the shelters all the rest rushed off he s done as much as i have only simon s always about ralph started back to the shelters with jack by his side do a bit for you muttered jack before i have a bathe don t bother but when they reached the shelters simon was not to be seen ralph put his head in the hole withdrew it and turned to jack he s buzzed off got fed up said jack and gone for a bathe ralph frowned he s queer he s funny jack nodded as much for the sake of agreeing as anything and by tacit consent they left the shelter and went toward the bathing pool and then said jack when i ve had a bathe and something to eat i ll just trek over to the other side of the mountain and see if i can see any traces coming but the sun s nearly set i might have time they walked along two continents of experience and feeling unable to communicate if i could only get a pig i ll come back and go on with the shelter they looked at each other baffled in love and hate all the warm salt water of the bathing pool and the shouting and splashing and laughing were only just sufficient to bring them together again simon was not in the bathing pool as they had expected when the other two had trotted down the beach to look back at the mountain he had followed them for a few yards and then stopped he had stood frowning down at a pile of sand on the beach where somebody had been trying to build a little house or hut then he turned his back on this and walked into the forest with an air of purpose he was a small skinny boy his chin pointed and his eyes so bright they had deceived ralph into thinking him delightfully gay and wicked the coarse mop of black hair was long and swung down almost concealing a low broad forehead he wore the remains of shorts and his feet were bare like jack s always darkish in color simon was burned by the sun to a deep tan that glistened with sweat he picked his way up the scar passed the great rock where ralph had climbed on the first morning then turned off to his right among the trees he walked with an accustomed tread through the acres of fruit trees where the least energetic could find an easy if unsatisfying meal flower and fruit grew together on the same tree and everywhere was the scent of ripeness and the booming of a million bees at pasture here the littlums who had run after him caught up with him they talked cried out unintelligibly lugged him toward the trees then amid the roar of bees in the afternoon sunlight simon found for them the fruit they could not reach pulled off the choicest from up in the foliage passed them back down to the endless outstretched hands when he had satisfied them he paused and looked round the littluns watched him inscrutably over double handfuls of ripe fruit simon turned away from them and went where the just perceptible path led him soon high jungle closed in tall trunks bore unexpected pale flowers all the way up to the dark canopy where life went on clamorously the air here was dark too and the creepers dropped their ropes like the rigging of foundered ships his feet left prints in the soft soil and the creepers shivered throughout their lengths when he bumped them he came at last to a place where more sunshine fell since they had not so far to go for light the creepers had woven a great mat that hung at the side of an open space in the jungle for here a patch of rock came close to the surface and would not allow more than little plants and ferns to grow the whole space was walled with dark aromatic bushes and was a bowl of heat and light a great tree fallen across one corner leaned against the trees that still stood arid a rapid climber flaunted red and yellow sprays right to the top simon paused he looked over his shoulder as jack had done at the close ways behind him and glanced swiftly round to confirm that he was utterly alone for a moment his movements were almost furtive then he bent down and wormed his way into the center of the mat the creepers and the bushes were so close that he left his sweat on them and they pulled together behind him when he was secure in the middle he was in a little cabin screened off from the open space by a few leaves he squatted down parted the leaves arid looked out into the clearing nothing moved but a pair of gaudy butterflies that danced round each other in the hot air holding his breath he cocked a critical ear at the sounds of the island evening was advancing toward the island the sounds of the bright fantastic birds the bee sounds even the crying of the gulls that were returning to their roosts among the square rocks were fainter the deep sea breaking miles away on the reef made an undertone less perceptible than the susurration of the blood simon dropped the screen of leaves back into place the slope of the bars of honey colored sunlight decreased they slid up the bushes passed over the green candle like buds moved up toward tile canopy and darkness thickened under the trees with the fading of the light the riotous colors died and the heat and urgency cooled away the candle buds stirred their green sepals drew back a little and the white tips of the flowers rose delicately to meet the open air now the sunlight had lifted clear of the open space and withdrawn from the sky darkness poured out submerging the ways between the trees tin they were dim and strange as the bottom of the sea the candle buds opened their wide white flowers glimmering under the light that pricked down from the first stars their scent spilled out into the air and took possession of the island embed,"['dog', 'drop', 'brown', 'laugh', 'thicken', 'ape', 'grey', 'masse', 'accustomed', 'mile', 'mad',

,spotify:track:4G9DH4xoOyDmvorTbJOJZB,ix little god lyrics marvin hi uh i m marvin i ve been coming here for a while but i haven t ever shared i m a well my thing s a little different i guess things started for me about six months ago my wife and i had a baby and it s been you know all the clich s it s a miracle but it s been hell on my sleep cuz once i m up i m up so i started getting into late night comment sessions on science forums evolution intelligent design that kind of thing now i m actually a neurochemist i focus on the effects of audio stimuli on brain chemistry you know neural plasticity and dopamine production as they relate to music subpartial alpha beta waves microtonal phase shifts lydian quark compressions you know i m a real dork for this stuff but for whatever reason intelligent design is what really gets me going like i just go trolling the boards though not trolling really i mean i actually try to engage educate a little but you know these people it s just impossible it s like throwing your mind against a wall and i get so heated man it s like i m intolerant of unintelligence you know it s my fatal flaw i might as well be getting mad at people for not being able to do calculus just take the derivative fool but i get it science is suspect i mean look at nutrition like the scientific evidence for whether you should eat wheat or not is crazy or if acupuncture works you know as layman we trust that what we hear from our preferred media and peers is right but skepticism is a necessary and healthy trait in a scientist or at least that s what i thought so a couple nights ago cora gets up at like am and it s my turn my wife had an early morning so i get her down and then go straight under my cans put on some binaural meditation beats and get to it and i m raging away on someone talking about the evolution of the eye when suddenly in my headphones i start hearing something weird the chorus begins to sing there s a sort of crystal ringing in the hertz range sort of a tinny electric crackle it gets me curious so i export the file isolate the frequency pitch shift it slow it down and when i do all that it resolves into the sound of a hushed new age voice saying god c horus hello marvin i think this is god marvin hello marvin i think this is god human c horus sounds like someone was having a laugh with you marvin right of course that s what i thought but then the voice answers that thought god c horus no no i m not having a laugh marvin and i thought well that s strange because this was recorded audio it s not streaming live and then the voice says god c horus well no but i m omnipresent including in time so it s all sort of the same thing for me marvin so i throw my headphones off and go to bed figured i was exhausted overworked you know but then in the morning i get a phone call i thought it might be the nanny running late but no you might also like god c horus i m sorry about last night this is probably a more normal way to talk to you marvin well if you re god a burning bush would actually be more normal god c horus ha ha ha no not that god i mean that s a version of me but i m the one real god at least i think human c horus huh marvin yeah so i was starting to get a little freaked out at this point but still i was definitely not falling for it so i play along well what makes you think you re god can you do some kind of miracle or something and at that point my phone turned into a fish human c horus okay marvin no no not okay human c horus what kind of fish was it marvin i don t know i don t really know kinds of fish like a trout maybe it was phone sized human c horus trout are a bit bigger than that i think yeah trout are like this big marvin like i said i don t really know fish but honestly i m starting to freak out here like i am having a mental episode and so i m like get out of the house get on my bike head to the lab but when i get there i find out that everyone else has had the same experience susie walt trillian kamala the two jacks they re all freaking out kamala says her phone turned into a kitten and jack says henry jack why didn t we all get kittens god c horus well i knew some of you were allergic marvin and we all hear that god is in all of our heads and we are freaking out god c horus don t freak out don t freak out i m sorry it s never easy making first contact look i m just gonna come in now marvin and then through the door walks an year old girl in a mermaid costume human c horus what marvin she says she s trying appearing as a playful child so she seems less threatening but so we re all just taking it in and then walt says toby walt ok well can you do a miracle all of us will see marvin and so then she rolls her eyes she has all these very tween affectations and then the coffee maker turns into a baby pterodactyl human c horus what marvin yeah susie was really into it jessica susie hey little buddy aren t you a long way from home marvin she goes over to it with a pencil and tries to get it to bite it and it s pretty cute but then we re all just wait marvin lab c horus what the fuck is going on here god c horus i can do some things but i m not sure if i m actually god i was hoping you could run some tests and see if these are miracles marvin and here s where we start going down the rabbit hole now i am a devout atheist but i ve always believed that if i was confronted with irrefutable evidence of god as a good scientist i would change my mind and here was my chance to test that to test my atheism and devotion to rationalism and i gotta say we took care of the pterodactyl pretty quick we had hypotheses i mean first off there s the jurassic park amber thing other ways dna could be preserved or time travel spacetime wormholes which aren t even that controversial in scientific communities or there s molecular printing just reorganizing the molecules from the coffee maker into the form of a pterodactyl which is also pretty non controversial speculative science like years from now we can probably do this human c horus so you re saying you guys did not take the pterodactyl to be a miracle marvin right we just postulated that there could be explanations beyond our technological capabilities that were not supernatural or holy so then we re like okay what next and i gotta say little god was great she did whatever we asked velma karly jessica human c horus what else did you ask her to do marvin first we asked for a bunch of basically telekinetic and transformational stuff all the big bible clich s walking on water water into wine splitting the red sea paula human c horus you did that marvin oh yeah we went to the beach plus little god is really into historical accuracy so we actually did it in egypt circa bce jessica toby human c horus you time traveled marvin yeah wormhole no big and then the water too no big because if we re postulating future technologies space time distortions gravity flux that kind of stuff quickly becomes just not that impressive i mean sure impressive but not miraculous human c horus it sounds like maybe this is just some very evolutionarily advanced intelligence right where does the god stuff come from marvin well first she claims to have created the universe so we carbon date her and her age is infinite in both directions suggesting that she s immortal but then that actually gets pretty dark because jack says ed jack well can we kill her marvin and we re all like no we re not going to try to kill an year old child but then little god just gets up real calm and breaks into a full suicide sprint right across the break room smashing her fucking head right into the fucking metal door bam human c horus fwap oh my god marvin and she hits the door hard and there is this awful awful wet cracking sound and we see her skull get completely smashed in and there s blood dripping down the door and bits of brain everywhere and she is dead and we re gonna have nightmares for the rest of our lives and then we hear the other door open behind us and there she is little god she saunters back in all cool and casual and is all god c horus see i m fine jessica paula henry ed human c horus wait and her body is still on the ground marvin yeah velma karly toby human c horus so there s two of her marvin yeah so there s two of her human c horus bwuh marvin but even this she helps us explain by postulating a whole mess of super advanced tech i mean we already know it s easy to form any old heap of molecules into an year old body and with dna printing and cerebral uploading we had an explanation for any kind of lazarus stuff she pulled and as for her soul god c horus soul is a matterless infinite substance that exists outside of time and is constantly separating and reforming marvin so i don t know that one kind of turned into semantics but honestly at this point were starting to doubt everything like kamala starts in on the uncertainty principle are our observations affecting the data or is little god manipulating the data she could be deceiving us by changing the microchips or moving the ink on the whiteboard she could be corrupting our actual brain waves none of us could prove that this wasn t just a simple multi player vr toby matrix human c horus except toby but when you get to that level of skepticism i mean of course you know that s a possibility in the back of your head human c horus add toby but you don t live like that it s paralyzing marvin no i know i know but if we re being scientific scientific about the existence of god then we can t discount those possibilities i mean evolutionarily we are still infants technologically and mentally we haven t even hit singularity yet our little st century human minds can t even begin to conceptualize some of the actual laws of physics and if we accept that there may be explanations that are simply beyond our own intelligence then what evidence could she possibly come up with clarke s third law god c horus any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic marvin if i can explain away something that by all criteria satisfies any definition of god then i can explain away anything any miracle any wonder any feeling any sense of love or responsibility or moral or just sense of meaning i look into my daughter s eyes my wife what does it mean we tried so hard to shatter our skepticism but it was like throwing our minds against a wall we traveled into black holes into quarks we slipped through time backwards and sideways we created new life forms living suns we watched the universe multiply invert spiral disappear we beheld an infinity of wonders and yet we sat at our desks in stoic calculation stripped of awe paralyzed by the unforgiving relentlessness of our intellect the music subsides velma you re the hanged man it s a tarot card it s it s supposed to be this thing where everything flips all the stress and shit of life finally just rocks you so hard that you can t take it anymore and you think and think and think until everything you thought you believed in everything you thought was essential to you suddenly seems all wrong so you strap yourself to a post you hurt yourself the world is upside down and you re trapped and you ll do anything just to feel something after the hanged man sees the world for what it is after she survives the temptations of temperance devils and death she must pass through a cleansing fire the hanged man must enter the tower and be struck down annihilated they say you have to go through that part to get to the really good stuff paula thank you for sharing marvin now it s time for tea embed,"['trust', 'laugh', 'binaural', 'mad', 'mess', 'park', 'hurt', 'accuracy',

brought a great many visitors it was the way of the place always to call on mrs edwards the morning after a ball and this neighbourly inclination was increased in the present instance by a general spirit of curiosity on emma s account as everybody wanted to look again at the girl who had been admired the night before by lord osborne many were the eyes and various the degrees of approbation with which she was examined some saw no fault and some no beauty with some her brown skin was the annihilation of every grace and others could never be persuaded that she was half so handsome as elizabeth watson had been ten years ago the morning passed quickly away in discussing the merits of the ball with all this succession of company and emma was at once astonished by finding it two o clock and considering that she had heard nothing of her father s chair after this discovery she had walked twice to the window to examine the street and was on the point of asking leave to ring the bell and make inquiries when the light sound of a carriage driving up to the door set her heart at ease she stepped again to the window but instead of the convenient though very un smart family equipage perceived a neat curricle mr musgrave was shortly afterwards announced and mrs edwards put on her very stiffest look at the sound not at all dismayed however by her chilling air he paid his compliments to each of the ladies with no unbecoming ease and continuing to address emma presented her a note which he had the honour of bringing from her sister but to which he must observe a verbal postscript from himself would be requisite the note which emma was beginning to read rather before mrs edwards had entreated her to use no ceremony contained a few lines from elizabeth importing that their father in consequence of being unusually well had taken the sudden resolution of attending the visitation that day and that as his road lay quite wide from d it was impossible for her to come home till the following morning unless the edwardses would send her which was hardly to be expected or she could meet with any chance conveyance or did not mind walking so far she had scarcely run her eye through the whole before she found herself obliged to listen to tom musgrave s farther account i received that note from the fair hands of miss watson only ten minutes ago said he i met her in the village of stanton whither my good stars prompted me to turn my horses heads she was at that moment in quest of a person to employ on the errand and i was fortunate enough to convince her that she could not find a more willing or speedy messenger than myself remember i say nothing of my disinterestedness my reward is to be the indulgence of conveying you to stanton in my curricle though they are not written down i bring your sister s orders for the same emma felt distressed she did not like the proposal she did not wish to be on terms of intimacy with the proposer and yet fearful of encroaching on the edwardses as well as wishing to go home herself she was at a loss how entirely to decline what he offered mrs edwards continued silent either not understanding the case or waiting to see how the young lady s inclination lay emma thanked him but professed herself very unwilling to give him so much trouble the trouble was of course honour pleasure delight what had he or his horses to do still she hesitated she believed she must beg leave to decline his assistance she was rather afraid of the sort of carriage the distance was not beyond a walk mrs edwards was silent no longer she inquired into the particulars and then said we shall be extremely happy miss emma if you can give us the pleasure of your company till tomorrow but if you cannot conveniently do so our carriage is quite at your service and mary will be pleased with the opportunity of seeing your sister this was precisely what emma had longed for and she accepted the offer most thankfully acknowledging that as elizabeth was entirely alone it was her wish to return home to dinner the plan was warmly opposed by their visitor i cannot suffer it indeed i must not be deprived of the happiness of escorting you i assure you there is not a possibility of fear with my horses you might guide them yourself your sisters all know how quiet they are they have none of them the smallest scruple in trusting themselves with me even on a race course believe me added he lowering his voice you are quite safe the danger is only mine emma was not more disposed to oblige him for all this and as to mrs edwards carriage being used the day after a ball it is a thing quite out of rule i assure you never heard of before the old coachman will look as black as his horses won t he miss edwards no notice was taken the ladies were silently firm and the gentleman found himself obliged to submit what a famous ball we had last night he cried after a short pause how long did you keep it up after the osbornes and i went away we had two dances more it is making it too much of a fatigue i think to stay so late i suppose your set was not a very full one yes quite as full as ever except the osbornes there seemed no vacancy anywhere and everybody danced with uncommon spirit to the very last emma said this though against her conscience indeed perhaps i might have looked in upon you again if i had been aware of as much for i am rather fond of dancing than not miss osborne is a charming girl is not she i do not think her handsome replied emma to whom all this was chiefly addressed perhaps she is not critically handsome but her manners are delightful and fanny carr is a most interesting little creature you can imagine nothing more naive or piquante and what do you think of lord osborne miss watson he would be handsome even though he were not a lord and perhaps better bred more desirous of pleasing and showing himself pleased in a right place upon my word you are severe upon my friend i assure you lord osborne is a very good fellow i do not dispute his virtues but i do not like his careless air if it were not a breach of confidence replied tom with an important look perhaps i might be able to win a more favourable opinion of poor osborne emma gave him no encouragement and he was obliged to keep his friend s secret he was also obliged to put an end to his visit for mrs edwards having ordered her carriage there was no time to be lost on emma s side in preparing for it miss edwards accompanied her home but as it was dinner hour at stanton stayed with them only a few minutes now my dear emma said miss watson as soon as they were alone you must talk to me all the rest of the day without stopping or i shall not be satisfied but first of all nanny shall bring in the dinner poor thing you will not dine as you did yesterday for we have nothing but some fried beef how nice mary edwards looks in her new pelisse and now tell me how you like them all and what i am to say to sam i have begun my letter jack stokes is to call for it tomorrow for his uncle is going within a mile of guildford the next day nanny brought in the dinner we will wait upon ourselves continued elizabeth and then we shall lose no time and so you would not come home with tom musgrave no you had said so much against him that i could not wish either for the obligation or the intimacy which the use of his carriage must have created i should not even have liked the appearance of it you did very right though i wonder at your forbearance and i do not think i could have done it myself he seemed so eager to fetch you that i could not say no though it rather went against me to be throwing you together so well as i knew his tricks but i did long to see you and it was a clever way of getting you home besides it won t do to be too nice nobody could have thought of the edwardses letting you have their coach after the horses being out so late but what am i to say to sam if you are guided by me you will not encourage him to think of miss edwards the father is decidedly against him the mother shows him no favour and i doubt his having any interest with mary she danced twice with captain hunter and i think shows him in general as much encouragement as is consistent with her disposition and the circumstances she is placed in she once mentioned sam and certainly with a little confusion but that was perhaps merely owing to the consciousness of his liking her which may very probably have come to her knowledge oh dear yes she has heard enough of that from us all poor sam he is out of luck as well as other people for the life of me emma i cannot help feeling for those that are crossed in love well now begin and give me an account of everything as it happened emma obeyed her and elizabeth listened with very little interruption till she heard of mr howard as a partner dance with mr howard good heavens you don t say so why he is quite one of the great and grand ones did you not find him very high his manners are of a kind to give me much more ease and confidence than tom musgrave s well go on i should have been frightened out of my wits to have had anything to do with the osbornes set emma concluded her narration and so you really did not dance with tom musgrave at all but you must have liked him you must have been struck with him altogether i do not like him elizabeth i allow his person and air to be good and that his manners to a certain point his address rather is pleasing but i see nothing else to admire in him on the contrary he seems very vain very conceited absurdly anxious for distinction and absolutely contemptible in some of the measures he takes for becoming so there is a ridiculousness about him that entertains me but his company gives me no other agreeable emotion my dearest emma you are like nobody else in the world it is well margaret is not by you do not offend me though i hardly know how to believe you but margaret would never forgive such words i wish margaret could have heard him profess his ignorance of her being out of the country he declared it seemed only two days since he had seen her aye that is just like him and yet this is the man she will fancy so desperately in love with her he is no favourite of mine as you well know emma but you must think him agreeable can you lay your hand on your heart and say you do not indeed i can both hands and spread to their widest extent i should like to know the man you do think agreeable his name is howard howard dear me i cannot think of him but as playing cards with lady osborne and looking proud i must own however that it is a relief to me to find you can speak as you do of tom musgrave my heart did misgive me that you would like him too well you talked so stoutly beforehand that i was sadly afraid your brag would be punished i only hope it will last and that he will not come on to pay you much attention it is a hard thing for a woman to stand against the flattering ways of a man when he is bent upon pleasing her as their quietly sociable little meal concluded miss watson could not help observing how comfortably it had passed it is so delightful to me said she to have things going on in peace and good humour nobody can tell how much i hate quarrelling now though we have had nothing but fried beef how good it has all seemed i wish everybody were as easily satisfied as you but poor margaret is very snappish and penelope owns she had rather have quarrelling going on than nothing at all mr watson returned in the evening not the worse for the exertion of the day and consequently pleased with what he had done and glad to talk of it over his own fireside emma had not foreseen any interest to herself in the occurrences of a visitation but when she heard mr howard spoken of as the preacher and as having given them an excellent sermon she could not help listening with a quicker ear i do not know when i have heard a discourse more to my mind continued mr watson or one better delivered he reads extremely well with great propriety and in a very impressive manner and at the same time without any theatrical grimace or violence i own i do not like much action in the pulpit i do not like the studied air and artificial inflexions of voice which your very popular and most admired preachers generally have a simple delivery is much better calculated to inspire devotion and shows a much better taste mr howard read like a scholar and a gentleman and what had you for dinner sir said his eldest daughter he related the dishes and told what he had ate himself upon the whole he added i have had a very comfortable day my old friends were quite surprised to see me amongst them and i must say that everybody paid me great attention and seemed to feel for me as an invalid they would make me sit near the fire and as the partridges were pretty high dr richards would have them sent away to the other end of the table that they might not offend mr watson which i thought very kind of him but what pleased me as much as anything was mr howard s attention there is a pretty steep flight of steps up to the room we dine in which do not quite agree with my gouty foot and mr howard walked by me from the bottom to the top and would make me take his arm it struck me as very becoming in so young a man but i am sure i had no claim to expect it for i never saw him before in my life by the by he inquired after one of my daughters but i do not know which i suppose you know among yourselves on the third day after the ball as nanny at five minutes before three was beginning to bustle into the parlour with the tray and the knife case she was suddenly called to the front door by the sound of as smart a rap as the end of a riding whip could give and though charged by miss watson to let nobody in returned in half a minute with a look of awkward dismay to hold the parlour door open for lord osborne and tom musgrave the surprise of the young ladies may be imagined no visitors would have been welcome at such a moment but such visitors as these such a one as lord osborne at least a nobleman and a stranger was really distressing he looked a little embarrassed himself as on being introduced by his easy voluble friend he muttered something of doing himself the honour of waiting upon mr watson though emma could not but take the compliment of the visit to herself she was very far from enjoying it she felt all the inconsistency of such an acquaintance with the very humble style in which they were obliged to live and having in her aunt s family been used to many of the elegancies of life was fully sensible of all that must be open to the ridicule of richer people in her present home of the pain of such feelings elizabeth knew very little her simple mind or juster reason saved her from such mortification and though shrinking under a general sense of inferiority she felt no particular shame mr watson as the gentlemen had already heard from nanny was not well enough to be down stairs with much concern they took their seats lord osborne near emma and the convenient mr musgrave in high spirits at his own importance on the other side of the fireplace with elizabeth he was at no loss for words but when lord osborne had hoped that emma had not caught cold at the ball he had nothing more to say for some time and could only gratify his eye by occasional glances at his fair neighbour emma was not inclined to give herself much trouble for his entertainment and after hard labour of mind he produced the remark of its being a very fine day and followed it up with the question of have you been walking this morning no my lord we thought it too dirty you should wear half boots after another pause nothing sets off a neat ankle more than a half boot nankeen galoshed with black looks very well do not you like half boots yes but unless they are so stout as to injure their beauty they are not fit for country walking ladies should ride in dirty weather do you ride no my lord i wonder every lady does not a woman never looks better than on horseback but every woman may not have the inclination or the means if they knew how much it became them they would all have the inclination and i fancy miss watson when once they had the inclination the means would soon follow your lordship thinks we always have our own way that is a point on which ladies and gentlemen have long disagreed but without pretending to decide it i may say that there are some circumstances which even women cannot control female economy will do a great deal my lord but it cannot turn a small income into a large one lord osborne was silenced her manner had been neither sententious nor sarcastic but there was a something in its mild seriousness as well as in the words themselves which made his lordship think and when he addressed her again it was with a degree of considerate propriety totally unlike the half awkward half fearless style of his former remarks it was a new thing with him to wish to please a woman it was the first time that he had ever felt what was due to a woman in emma s situation but as he wanted neither in sense nor a good disposition he did not feel it without effect you have not been long in this country i understand said he in the tone of a gentleman i hope you are pleased with it he was rewarded by a gracious answer and a more liberal full view of her face than she had yet bestowed unused to exert himself and happy in contemplating her he then sat in silence for some minutes longer while tom musgrave was chattering to elizabeth till they were interrupted by nanny s approach who half opening the door and putting in her head said please ma am master wants to know why he ben t to have his dinner the gentlemen who had hitherto disregarded every symptom however positive of the nearness of that meal now jumped up with apologies while elizabeth called briskly after nanny to tell betty to take up the fowls i am sorry it happens so she added turning good humouredly towards musgrave but you know what early hours we keep tom had nothing to say for himself he knew it very well and such honest simplicity such shameless truth rather bewildered him lord osborne s parting compliments took some time his inclination for speech seeming to increase with the shortness of the term for indulgence he recommended exercise in defiance of dirt spoke again in praise of half boots begged that his sister might be allowed to send emma the name of her shoemaker and concluded with saying my hounds will be hunting this country next week i believe they will throw off at stanton wood on wednesday at nine o clock i mention this in hopes of your being drawn out to see what s going on if the morning s tolerable pray do us the honour of giving us your good wishes in person the sisters looked on each other with astonishment when their visitors had withdrawn here s an unaccountable honour cried elizabeth at last who would have thought of lord osborne s coming to stanton he is very handsome but tom musgrave looks all to nothing the smartest and most fashionable man of the two i am glad he did not say anything to me i would not have had to talk to such a great man for the world tom was very agreeable was not he but did you hear him ask where miss penelope and miss margaret were when he first came in it put me out of patience i am glad nanny had not laid the cloth however it would have looked so awkward just the tray did not signify to say that emma was not flattered by lord osborne s visit would be to assert a very unlikely thing and describe a very odd young lady but the gratification was by no means unalloyed his coming was a sort of notice which might please her vanity but did not suit her pride and she would rather have known that he wished the visit without presuming to make it than have seen him at stanton among other unsatisfactory feelings it once occurred to her to wonder why mr howard had not taken the same privilege of coming and accompanied his lordship but she was willing to suppose that he had either known nothing about it or had declined any share in a measure which carried quite as much impertinence in its form as good breeding mr watson was very far from being delighted when he heard what had passed a little peevish under immediate pain and ill disposed to be pleased he only replied phoo phoo what occasion could there be for lord osborne s coming i have lived here fourteen years without being noticed by any of the family it is some foolery of that idle fellow tom musgrave i cannot return the visit i would not if i could and when tom musgrave was met with again he was commissioned with a message of excuse to osborne castle on the too sufficient plea of mr watson s infirm state of health a week or ten days rolled quietly away after this visit before any new bustle arose to interrupt even for half a day the tranquil and affectionate intercourse of the two sisters whose mutual regard was increasing with the intimate knowledge of each other which such intercourse produced the first circumstance to break in on this security was the receipt of a letter from croydon to announce the speedy return of margaret and a visit of two or three days from mr and mrs robert watson who undertook to bring her home and wished to see their sister emma it was an expectation to fill the thoughts of the sisters at stanton and to busy the hours of one of them at least for as jane had been a woman of fortune the preparations for her entertainment were considerable and as elizabeth had at all times more goodwill than method in her guidance of the house she could make no change without a bustle an absence of fourteen years had made all her brothers and sisters strangers to emma but in her expectation of margaret there was more than the awkwardness of such an alienation she had heard things which made her dread her return and the day which brought the party to stanton seemed to her the probable conclusion of almost all that had been comfortable in the house robert watson was an attorney at croydon in a good way of business very well satisfied with himself for the same and for having married the only daughter of the attorney to whom he had been clerk with a fortune of six thousand pounds mrs robert was not less pleased with herself for having had that six thousand pounds and for being now in possession of a very smart house in croydon where she gave genteel parties and wore fine clothes in her person there was nothing remarkable her manners were pert and conceited margaret was not without beauty she had a slight pretty figure and rather wanted countenance than good features but the sharp and anxious expression of her face made her beauty in general little felt on meeting her long absent sister as on every occasion of show her manner was all affection and her voice all gentleness continual smiles and a very slow articulation being her constant resource when determined on pleasing she was now so delighted to see dear dear emma that she could hardly speak a word in a minute i am sure we shall be great friends she observed with much sentiment as they were sitting together emma scarcely knew how to answer such a proposition and the manner in which it was spoken she could not attempt to equal mrs robert watson eyed her with much familiar curiosity and triumphant compassion the loss of the aunt s fortune was uppermost in her mind at the moment of meeting and she could not but feel how much better it was to be the daughter of a gentleman of property in croydon than the niece of an old woman who threw herself away on an irish captain robert was carelessly kind as became a prosperous man and a brother more intent on settling with the post boy inveighing against the exorbitant advance in posting and pondering over a doubtful half crown than on welcoming a sister who was no longer likely to have any property for him to get the direction of your road through the village is infamous elizabeth said he worse than ever it was by heaven i would indict it if i lived near you who is surveyor now there was a little niece at croydon to be fondly inquired after by the kind hearted elizabeth who regretted very much her not being of the party you are very good replied her mother and i assure you it went very hard with augusta to have us come away without her i was forced to say we were only going to church and promise to come back for her directly but you know it would not do to bring her without her maid and i am as particular as ever in having her properly attended to sweet little darling cried margaret it quite broke my heart to leave her then why was you in such a hurry to run away from her cried mrs robert you are a sad shabby girl i have been quarrelling with you all the way we came have not i such a visit as this i never heard of you know how glad we are to have any of you with us if it be for months together and i am sorry with a witty smile we have not been able to make croydon agreeable this autumn my dearest jane do not overpower me with your raillery you know what inducements i had to bring me home spare me i entreat you i am no match for your arch sallies well i only beg you will not set your neighbours against the place perhaps emma may be tempted to go back with us and stay till christmas if you don t put in your word emma was greatly obliged i assure you we have very good society at croydon i do not much attend the balls they are rather too mixed but our parties are very select and good i had seven tables last week in my drawing room are you fond of the country how do you like stanton very much replied emma who thought a comprehensive answer most to the purpose she saw that her sister in law despised her immediately mrs robert watson was indeed wondering what sort of a home emma could possibly have been used to in shropshire and setting it down as certain that the aunt could never have had six thousand pounds how charming emma is whispered margaret to mrs robert in her most languishing tone emma was quite distressed by such behaviour and she did not like it better when she heard margaret five minutes afterwards say to elizabeth in a sharp quick accent totally unlike the first have you heard from pen since she went to chichester i had a letter the other day i don t find she is likely to make anything of it i fancy she ll come back miss penelope as she went such she feared would be margaret s common voice when the novelty of her own appearance were over the tone of artificial sensibility was not recommended by the idea the ladies were invited upstairs to prepare for dinner i hope you will find things tolerably comfortable jane said elizabeth as she opened the door of the spare bedchamber my good creature replied jane use no ceremony with me i entreat you i am one of those who always take things as they find them i hope i can put up with a small apartment for two or three nights without making a piece of work i always wish to be treated quite en famille when i come to see you and now i do hope you have not been getting a great dinner for us remember we never eat suppers i suppose said margaret rather quickly to emma you and i are to be together elizabeth always takes care to have a room to herself no elizabeth gives me half hers oh in a softened voice and rather mortified to find that she was not ill used i am sorry i am not to have the pleasure of your company especially as it makes me nervous to be much alone emma was the first of the females in the parlour again on entering it she found her brother alone so emma said he you are quite a stranger at home it must seem odd enough for you to be here a pretty piece of work your aunt turner has made of it by heaven a woman should never be trusted with money i always said she ought to have settled something on you as soon as her husband died but that would have been trusting me with money replied emma and i am a woman too it might have been secured to your future use without your having any power over it now what a blow it must have been upon you to find yourself instead of heiress of or l sent back a weight upon your family without a sixpence i hope the old woman will smart for it do not speak disrespectfully of her she was very good to me and if she has made an imprudent choice she will suffer more from it herself than i can possibly do i do not mean to distress you but you know everybody must think her an old fool i thought turner had been reckoned an extraordinarily sensible clever man how the devil came he to make such a will my uncle s sense is not at all impeached in my opinion by his attachment to my aunt she had been an excellent wife to him the most liberal and enlightened minds are always the most confiding the event has been unfortunate but my uncle s memory is if possible endeared to me by such a proof of tender respect for my aunt that s odd sort of talking he might have provided decently for his widow without leaving everything that he had to dispose of or any part of it at her mercy my aunt may have erred said emma warmly she has erred but my uncle s conduct was faultless i was her own niece and he left to herself the power and the pleasure of providing for me but unluckily she has left the pleasure of providing for you to your father and without the power that s the long and short of the business after keeping you at a distance from your family for such a length of time as must do away all natural affection among us and breeding you up i suppose in a superior style you are returned upon their hands without a sixpence you know replied emma struggling with her tears my uncle s melancholy state of health he was a greater invalid than my father he could not leave home i do not mean to make you cry said robert rather softened and after a short silence by way of changing the subject he added i am just come from my father s room he seems very indifferent it will be a sad break up when he dies pity you can none of you get married you must come to croydon as well as the rest and see what you can do there i believe if margaret had had a thousand or fifteen hundred pounds there was a young man who would have thought of her emma was glad when they were joined by the others it was better to look at her sister in law s finery than listen to robert who had equally irritated and grieved her mrs robert exactly as smart as she had been at her own party came in with apologies for her dress i would not make you wait said she so i put on the first thing i met with i am afraid i am a sad figure my dear mr w to her husband you have not put any fresh powder in your hair no i do not intend it i think there is powder enough in my hair for my wife and sisters indeed you ought to make some alteration in your dress before dinner when you are out visiting though you do not at home nonsense it is very odd you should not like to do what other gentlemen do mr marshall and mr hemmings change their dress every day of their lives before dinner and what was the use of my putting up your last new coat if you are never to wear it do be satisfied with being fine yourself and leave your husband alone to put an end to this altercation and soften the evident vexation of her sister in law emma though in no spirits to make such nonsense easy began to admire her gown it produced immediate complacency do you like it said she i am very happy it has been excessively admired but sometimes i think the pattern too large i shall wear one tomorrow that i think you will prefer to this have you seen the one i gave margaret dinner came and except when mrs robert looked at her husband s head she continued gay and flippant chiding elizabeth for the profusion on the table and absolutely protesting against the entrance of the roast turkey which formed the only exception to you see your dinner i do beg and entreat that no turkey may be seen today i am really frightened out of my wits with the number of dishes we have already let us have no turkey i beseech you my dear replied elizabeth the turkey is roasted and it may just as well come in as stay in the kitchen besides if it is cut i am in hopes my father may be tempted to eat a bit for it is rather a favourite dish you may have it in my dear but i assure you i sha n t touch it mr watson had not been well enough to join the party at dinner but was prevailed on to come down and drink tea with them i wish we may be able to have a game of cards tonight said elizabeth to mrs robert after seeing her father comfortably seated in his arm chair not on my account my dear i beg you know i am no card player i think a snug chat infinitely better i always say cards are very well sometimes to break a formal circle but one never wants them among friends i was thinking of its being something to ,"['trust', 'brown', 'scruple', 'race', 'secret', 'note', 'luck',

traits and practice of vampirism it was generally supposed that all suicides might after death become vampires and this was easily extended to those who met with any violent or sudden death mr lawson tells us that there persists a tradition in maina where the vendetta is still maintained that a man whose murder has not been avenged is liable to become a vrykolakas the mainotes who derive their name from the place maina near cape taenaron matapan even yet preserve many of the customs and characteristics of their ancestors and historically are known to be of a more pure greek descent than the inhabitants of any other district indeed the peninsula which thrusts into the sea the headland of taenaron has both social and religious customs of its own the population is distributed into small villages while here and there a white fortress will denote the residence of a chief a traveller writing in remarks the maina country is wild and beautiful singularly well cultivated considering the difficulties to be surmounted and producing crops that put to shade the rich plains of argos and arcadia whilst the interesting mountain people exercise the highland virtues of hospitality and independance to an extent unknown in the low countries it has been said that the last traveller who saw maina while retaining some remains of its primitive cateran glories was lord carnarvon who in explored the morea and has left us an extraordinarily interesting account of his journey the population of this district continued the worship of the pagan deities for full five hundred years after the rest of the roman empire had embraced christianity and they were not finally converted until the reign of the vigorous emperor basil i gibbon described them as a domestic and perhaps original race who in some degree might derive their blood from the much injured helotes and even yet p they boast of their descent from the ancient spartans whilst the histories of leonidas and lycurgus who figure partly as saints and partly as gallant brigands are still retold round the winter fireside the whole district including kaka voulia the land of evil counsel is formed by the hummocks and escarpments of mount taygetos and with the exception of a long strip of coast line which the venetians called bassa maina it is steep and hilly and for the most part barren the conquest of the morea was completed by mahomet ii in but maina could never be thoroughly subdued and its inhabitants remained as entirely independent as were the highlanders before culloden as has been remarked ancient traditions still persevere and among these customs not the least obstinate is the vendetta a man who has been murdered is unable to rest in his grave until he has been avenged accordingly he issues forth as a vampire thirsting for the blood of his enemy in order to bring about his physical dissolution and to secure his repose it is necessary for the next of kin to slay the murderer or at least some near relative of the murderer unless this is done the man upon whom the duty of avenging blood devolves is banned by the curse of the dead and if so be that he is himself cut off before he can satify the desires of the deceased the curse will yet cling to him even in death and he too must become a vampire it should be remarked that this view of blood guilt is found in the attic dramatists and is in fact the mainspring of the whole story of orestes in the tragedy of this name by euripides tyndareus the father of clytemnestra remonstrates very reasonably and indeed unanswerably with orestes but the hero replies and argues that if he has not avenged his father had not his hate s erinyes haunted me again in the choephoroe of aeschylus orestes pursues the same idea saying that unless he avenges his father a stern duty which has devolved upon him lie will be punished in turn by the avengers of his father s wrongs it may be remarked that in maina to day no recourse must be had to law for such cases nor must the injured person satisfy himself by calling upon the aid of the police to do this were incredibly base the subterfuge of a recreant and a craven even if it be a life s whole work a man is expected either secretly p or by an open attack to slay the murderer of his relative and he is highly applauded when he has accomplished this pious deed it must be appreciated that he is regarded as herein directed and inspired by the dead man who returns from his grave as a vampire craving for blood even if no other motive or incentive prevailed in spite of natural shrinking and may be even cowardice a man would undoubtedly prefer to shed blood for blood especially when this might be done in secrecy or by craft rather than run the terrible risk of himself becoming a vampire finding no rest in the grave but returning to haunt and persecute even those who were most dear to him an unclean thing accursed of god a foul goblin of dread most hateful to man so great is the horror which the act of suicide although considered admirable in the decadence of greece and rome inspires in every man of sane mind that it is not at all surprising it should be deemed that the unfortunate wretches who have destroyed themselves become vampires after death according to the zoroastrian creed suicide is a most fearful crime and is classed among the marg arzan the abominable offences aristotle in his ethics v xv terms suicide a sin against the state and as cicero tells us pythagoras forbade men to depart from their guard or sentry go in life without an order from their commanding officer who is god uetatque pythagoras iniussu imperatoris id est dei de praesidio et statione uitae decedere de senectute xx the highest pagan argument against suicide will be found in plato s phaedo e e but it is drowned in the mighty voice of the great saint of hippo which peals in no unwavering tones down the centuries for if it be not lawful for a private man to kill any man however guilty unless the law have granted a special allowance for it theft surely whosoever kills himself is guilty of homicide and so much the more guilty doth that killing of himself make himself by how much the more guiltless he was in that cause for which he killed himself for if the act of judas be worthily detested and yet the truth saith that by hanging of himself he did rather augment than expiate the guilt of his wicked treachery because his despair of god s mercy in his damnable repentance left no place in his soul for saving repentance how much more ought he to p forbear from being cause of his own death that hath no guilt in him worthy of such a punishment as death for judas in hanging himself hanged but a wicked man and died guilty not only of christ s death but of his own also adding the wickedness of being his own death to that other wickedness of his for which he died de ciuitate dei i xvii it may be well very briefly to present the teaching of the church concerning positive and direct suicide if done without god s permission this always constitutes a grave injustice towards him to destroy a thing is in effect to dispose of it as an absolute master and to act with regard to it as one who has full and independent dominion over it but god has reserved to himself dominion over life man cannot create life and he does not possess this full and absolute right over his own life consequently suicide must be reckoned as an attempt against the dominion and right of ownership of the author of life to this injustice is super added a serious offence against the charity owed by man to himself since by self murder he deprives himself of the greatest good in his possession moreover this sin may be aggravated by other circumstances such as an offence against conjugal paternal or filial duty an offence against justice or charity if by taking his own life a man eludes existing obligations of justice or acts of charity which he could and should perform that suicide is unlawful is the general teaching of holy scripture which condemns the act as a most terrible crime and to arouse the horror of all against holy church denies the suicide the rites of christian burial again suicide is directly opposed to the most natural and powerful tendency of all created things and especially of intelligent man the preservation of life indeed very large numbers of physicians moralists and jurists lay it down as a general rule that suicide is always due to dementia so great is the horror which this atrocious deed inspires in every man of sane mind as a generalization this may be admitted to be true for it is impossible to think that those who have the calm and right use of their reason should deliberately destroy themselves and the conditions which are necessary to incur the full culpability of an act can only in exceptional instances be conceived of as being present in the case of a suicide sabetti inquires quaenam ad peccatum mortale p

christian middle ages were free from the terrible tendency of suicide but with the loss of faith it re appeared and masaryk in his study der selbstmord als sociale massenerscheinung der modernen civilisation vienna considered it to be the special evil of these later days sad to relate self destruction has fearfully increased since the great war but it may perhaps be mitigatingly advanced that the reason of the world tottered almost to eternal delirium during the chaos and welter of blood and the balance is not recovered yet it is true that among certain nations there appears to be an indifference to human life nay a contempt of death itself which often takes the most extravagant and the most outrageous forms the goths the heathen vandals and norse savages not only approved but sought suicide and violent death it is of course only among the utterly benighted that it is possible for such abominable ideas to obtain for example there existed among a tribe of robbers in southern india customs of the utmost ferocity such practices as the following certainly prevailed during the eighteenth century but they have no doubt long since been happily suppressed if two persons had quarrelled sometimes for the most trifling reasons a man would kill himself merely in order to be revenged on his adversary he believed that p his ghost would be able to return and harry the surviver or at least that some dire retribution must fall on the head of his enemy who drove him to such extreme measures again custom required that if a man committed suicide letting it be known that it was on this account the person with whom he had had the difference that led to this abominable act must immediately follow his example lord avebury s statement it is said that in china if a rich man is condemned to death he can sometimes purchase a willing substitute at a very small expense has been traversed and professor parker would not commit himself any further than by saying it is popularly stated that substitutes can be bought for taels fifty and most certainly this statement is more than true so far as the price of human life is concerned but it is quite another question whether the gaolers and judges can always be bribed dr w t a barber who had been a missionary in china relates that he had known very large numbers of persons who committed suicide out of spite against some one else the idea being first the trouble given by minions of the law to the survivor second that the dead would gain a vantage ground by becoming a ghost and thus able to plague his enemy in the flesh it is not surprising to learn that in ancient times before the advent of christianity among such savage people as the celts and the thracians suicide was not only common but treated with the most appalling lightness and even flippancy thus athen us speaking of the banquets of the thracians quotes from seleueus as follows and seleueus says that some of the thracians at their drinking parties play the game of hanging and fix a round noose to some high place exactly beneath which they place a stone which is easily turned round when any one stands upon it and then they cast lots and he who draws the lot holding a sickle in his hand stands upon the stone and puts his neck into the halter and then another person comes and raises the stone and the man who is suspended when the stone moves from under him if he is not quick enough in cutting the rope with his sickle is killed and the rest laugh thinking his death good sport upon the authority of the famous stoic philosopher posidonius athen us tells us of similar brutalities which took place among the celts he writes but posidonius in the p third and also in the twentieth book of his histories says the celt sometimes have single combats at their entertainments for being collected in arms they go through the exercise and make feints at and sometimes they even go so far as to wound one another and being irritated by this if the bystanders do not stop them they will proceed even to kill one another but in olden times he continues there was a custom that a hind quarter of pork was put on the table and the bravest man took it and if any one else laid claim to it then the two rose up to fight till one of them was slain and other men in the theatre having received some silver or gold money and some even for a number of earthen vessels full of wine having taken pledges that the gifts promised shall really be given and having distributed them among their nearest connexions have laid themselves down on doors with their faces upwards and then allowed some bystander to cut their throats with a sword and euphorion the chalcidian in his historical memorials writes as follows but among the romans it is common for five min to be offered to any one who chooses to take it to allow his head to be cut off with an axe so that his heirs might receive the reward and very often many have returned their names as willingly so that there has been a regular contest between them as to who had the best right to be beaten to death these atrocious examples serve to show us something of the evil and the corruption of which christianity cleansed the pagan world although it is to be feared that the battle is not yet won since it is a notorious and deplorable fact that at the hour of such a crisis as the great war the respect due to human life became cheapened in men s eyes with the consequence that murder and deeds of violence once more broke out in every direction showing that savage instincts were dominated indeed but in many cases not wholly eradicated it does not require a keen perception to see the direct agency of the devil here and these atrocities which bred so callous and cruel a spirit are by no means altogether unconnected with the recrudescence of necromancy and black magic which foul arts once more grew green and were almost openly pursued on every side the belief that a man has not complete dominion over his own life and that it is unlawful for him to take it is certainly a p feeling naturally implanted in the human breast and it was only when nations were entirely barbarian or had became decadent and corrupt that the notion of suicide was held up as noble and even heroic whatever certain among the later greeks may have practised and taught in earlier days as we have seen the act of suicide was regarded as a dark and presumptuous deed they truly felt that there was in it something of something of that which so surely stirred the wrath of heaven and inevitably called down righteous vengeance indeed the evil and malice of suicide did not end with death but continued beyond the grave the umbra of a man who had slain himself was dreaded and feared so in ancient athens it was the custom to cut off the hand of a suicide and to cremate it or at least to bury it far from his body the object of such mutilation being to prevent his ghost from attacking the living similar beliefs exist among native african tribes thus the wajagga of east africa dread the spectres of suicides when a man has hanged himself a certain complicated ceremonial becomes imperative they take the rope from his neck and suspend a goat in the noose after which the animal is swiftly slain the idea seems that hereby the phantom will be in some way appeased and he will not be so likely to tempt human beings to follow his evil example the baganda of central africa have an even greater horror of the ghosts of suicides and the most elaborate precautions are invariably taken to protect themselves against these dangerous visitors the body of a man who has destroyed himself is removed as far from all human habitation as possible to waste land or to a cross road and there is utterly consumed with fire next the wood of the house in which the horrid deed has been done is burned to ashes and scattered to the winds whilst if the man has hanged himself upon a tree this is hewn to the ground and committed to the flames trunk roots branches and all even this is hardly deemed to be sufficient curiously enough there is a lurking idea that the ghost of a suicide may survive after the cremation of the body so horrible is this crime felt to be and so irradicated the taint that this terrible deed establishes this is extremely significant since the cases in which cremation a complete purgation and destruction by fire cannot obliterate guilt and p destroy the evil infection are indeed exceptional and it might be no easy task to find a parallel instance however the baganda when passing by the spot where the body of a suicide has been burned always take good care to pelt it with sticks and clods of earth to prevent the ghost from catching them although these places in particular are dangerous to the last degree there are other graves that may be haunted by phantoms which as they have no bodies are not strictly vampires but which certainly belong to the vampire family such are those remote places where persons who have been accused of black magic and who failed to satisfy the ritual ordeals have been burned to death as also those spots where persons of evil and atrocious life have been cremated or interred the maraves a tribe of south africa who also burned witches alive whenever they had occasion to pass the place of doom pelted it with stones and it is said that in some instances of spots considered particularly ill omened a regular cairn or tumulus of loose stones has arisen in madagascar too certain solitary graves bear an exceedingly ill repute so that the chance traveller with averted face throws stones at them or large lumps of earth in order to prevent the ghost following in his tracks and seizing on him it must be remarked and this is very important that the sticks and stones or heavy clods of earth with which a grave is pelted are not meant merely as a symbolical insult and expression of righteous indignation but are actually missiles which will strike and hurt the being who haunts the spot of interment so since the haunter can be struck and injured by these very material objects the heavier they are the better he must himself possess a certain concrete substantiality and inasmuch as objects make an impression upon him he must exist under some kind of physical condition doubtless the exact idea is not very clearly defined in the minds of those who are so careful to pelt the grave yet if stones will not merely ward off an attack from the haunter but when in the course of time they become piled up into a small cairn they serve to keep the deceased in his place that is to say in the grave there must be some sort of material entity which can be so materially frustrated and obstructed here then we have the essential and complete vampire it is recorded by a traveller about the middle of the last p century that when he was journeying in company with two mussulmans from sidon to tyre as he drew near the latter city he noticed a great pile of stones by the wayside whereupon his companions began to pick up all the loose pebbles that came to hand and discharged them violently at the heap at the same time uttering the most fearful imprecations when they had passed and were at some little distance they explained that a notorious brigand whose hands were stained with the hideous cruelties and innocent blood had been slain there and buried on the spot half a century before the stones they threw and their curses were directed against this villain it might be thought in this case that the missiles were a mark of loathing and contempt but it seems far more probable that they were intended to serve a very utilitarian purpose that is actually to keep off the wretch who would still be haunting the pit into which his body had been cast fifty years since it even appears that in many parts of syria when brigands are killed by the highway or vagrom murderers are dispatched in the open country side beyond the walls of a city the body is left to rot unburied where it lies and after a while it is merely covered over with a heap of stones moreover everyone who passes by is bound to quoit a stone or stick to add to the pile under the penalty of incurring some dreadful misfortune it is supposed that heaven will horribly curse the person who fails to throw his flinty tribute as he goes it is not only among rude african tribes and in the east that the graves of persons who have led cruel and anti social lives particularly the spots where suicides have been buried are thus places of execration and fear but in pomerania and in west prussia not to instance many other districts the spots where persons who have wrought their own destruction happen to be interred are regarded as unlucky in the highest degree and there is no more malevolent and harmful spectre than the suicide s ghost a man who has destroyed himself must not defile god s acre in no wise may he be buried in the churchyard but at the place where the desperate deed was done and everybody who passes by will cast a stone on the spot unless he wishes the ghost of the suicide to plague him nightly and to give him no rest until he is driven to the same dreadful fate it is said that as in africa piles of sticks p and stones accumulate to a great size so similar cairns rise upon these haunted spots in the more remote districts along the cold shores washed by the baltic sea it is not surprising to find that in a country such as russia which through the ages has so often tottered to madness and of late years fallen into stark lunacy during the seventeenth century an epidemic of suicide raged it persisted indeed at spasmodic intervals throughout the eighteenth and even the nineteenth centuries but it was somewhat earlier than this that the troubles of that luckless nation blazed out in furious frenzy as when the year approached a fearful apocalyptic mania inflamed many parts of europe and men imagining that the world was about to come to an end that almost any hour any moment the angel s clarion would blare heaven and earth shrivel like some parching scroll and the judge be set on his awful throne in their hundreds deserted cities and homes to wander abroad preaching fevered repentance and the most extravagent forms of penance or else in frantic despair abandoned themselves to debauchery and violence so in russia some mad visionary who proclaimed that the crack of doom was appointed for the year set the whole country aflame with terror in many parts men ceased to labour in the fields relinquished their businesses and all social intercourse barricaded themselves in their houses behind closed windows and fast barred doors awaiting the end with the gloomiest forebodings as might have been expected great numbers completely lost their senses and scores of dangerous lunatics not only infested the highroad but even invaded villages and towns preaching that the only way to escape the wrath to come was to prevent the final day by self destruction they were moreover very willing and eager to help those who shrank from so severe a test and before long red murder was rife in every direction their services however were not required as frequently as might have been supposed for the delirium spread with such alarming rapidity that not merely households but whole communities eagerly devoted themselves to death if in some paroxysm of wild hysteria a man had declared his intention of becoming a martyr for so these poor wretches were deemed the pious duty devolved upon his friends and relations of seeing that he scrupulously fulfilled his vow should he p wish to change his mind or in any way seek to escape his fate he was pursued and saved in spite of himself by being put to death in the most atrocious torments a veritable reign of terror ensued and northern russia seemed well nigh depopulated it were superfluous to enter into the horrible details but it may suffice to say that at first starvation was the usual method by which these maniacs committed suicide in the forest of vetlouga one fanatic at huge expense actually built a tower without doors and windows into the body of which persons were lowered through a trap in the roof but this was too long a process it gave space for reflection and with the pangs of hunger reason resumed her sway those within yelled to be released but all in vain to shouts and clamour succeeded groans and fainter lamentations until as the days passed all was still another remedy was found and presently the method which was preferred and which was officially prescribed as safer and more pleasing to god was immolation by fire accordingly the missionaries of this horrible impiety proclaimed safety through the flame as the prophet elias had ascended to heaven in a blazing chariot so the deluded wretches were taught they would ascend to a glorious and delightful eternity from the midst of the conflagration hundreds and even thousands perished in huge holocausts whole areas were strictly enclosed the candidates took their places therein and the compound having been previously drenched with pitch bitumen and inflammable oils torches were applied at many points if any overcome by agony escaped with scorched and blackened limbs they were caught and hurled back into the heart of the pyre these immolations generally took place during the dark winter season and from midnight until the faint streaks of dawn the red glow of these horrid furnaces could be seen in every direction for hundreds of verstas the land became a veritable tophet as the morning broke hordes of wolves attracted by the stench of roasting flesh assembled to pull trunks and limbs from the embers a dark cloud of suffocating smoke greasy with human fat that fouled both ground and houses hung low in the sky and ere many days were past the plague was stalking abroad with fatal voracity it was not until the most vigorous measures had been taken that these terrible practices could be checked and it seems that the p venom of the madness persisted long and late for as recently as fifteen persons in the district of olonetz committed suicide by fire whilst during the winter of twenty four religious fanatics buried themselves alive in a pit near tiraspol the monk falaley constantly preached that death was man s only means of salvation and that he must have done with this life of sin one night under his influence eighty four persons congregated near the river perevozinka and began to pray many of them were already half crazed through excessive fasting and they almost covered themselves with brambles and brushwood to which fire was to be set at a given signal a woman taking alarm at the thought of so horrible a death escaped and informed the authorities when the police arrived the fanatics shrieked that antichrist was approaching and setting fire to the pile most perished in the flames a few who were rescued received sentences of imprisonment and deportation but a fanatic called souchkoff managed to escape and continued to preach the gospel of death maddened by his doctrine in one locality alone sixty families resolved to commit suicide at a certain moment and a peasant named petroff entering a neighbour s house cut down his wife and children with a hatchet in a barn hard by a dozen men with their wives had assembled and amid hymns of triumph they laid their heads upon an improvised block to be hacked off by petroff in another hut a woman and three children were dispatched at their own earnest request at length when he was weary petroff himself kneeled down and was slain by souchkoff between and a maniac named chadkin proclaimed that antichrist was here and all most follow him to the forests and there die of hunger a large number assembled and his most devoted followers saw to it that nobody could escape after a few days the sufferings of the crowds were fearful and the place rang with their screams and groans nevertheless chadkin and his apostles did not waver when some poor creature frantic with agony managed to break away and informed the police the devotees at once began to kill all who had gathered together and by the time the authorities had arrived in the utmost haste there were found but three survivors buddhist monks in china are often recorded to have p sought their nirvana through an act of self immolation by fire and it is said that every year among the lamaresais of tien tai in the province of tai chow some half a dozen bonzes thus devote themselves to death these unfortunate persons believe that their voluntary destruction crowns the monastery with honours and blessing they are aware that they will be worshipped after their suicide and they suppose that they will become the divinities of the district and possess the power to protect the whole neighbourhood to grant fair weather and lucky seasons a bounteous harvest and all prosperity such public incinerations are conducted with great ceremony and take place upon a major festival which is bound to attract crowds of pilgrims and reverent suppliants to the spot it is said that among the eskimo of bering strait a sorcerer has been known to burn himself alive fully believing that thus he will return to life as a shaman with much greater powers and a far fuller knowledge of magic than he had hitherto enjoyed it may be remembered that even such low motives as vanity and a craving for mere notoriety have proved an incentive sufficiently powerful to induce men to seek a dramatic if painful death by fire thus the charlatan peregrinus after a career of the most braggart ostentation courted undying fame by self immolation upon a pyre at the olympic festival which extraordinary performance attracted throngs not only of sensible persons who despised and mocked him but of encomiasts and apologists who regarded him as at the least a hero if not something nearly approaching to deity it can hardly be argued that higher motives inspired empedocles if the account preserved by diogenes laertius to which horace makes reference be true namely that hoping by a sudden disappearance he might be accounted a god the philosopher flung himself into the crater of mount aetna but that the suicide was revealed owing to the fact that the volcano almost immediately after threw up one of his sandals and thus betrayed the manner of his death josephus states that the jews used not to bury the bodies of those who had destroyed themselves until after sunset in scotland it is still thought that the body of a suicide will not fall to dust until the time when he should have died in the order of nature and it is very generally held that a such p a one must be buried with the grave facing north and south this belief also existed in england and there are graves facing north and south to be seen at cowden kent and bergholt suffolk which are locally said to be those of persons who have destroyed themselves for it is almost universally declared that christian burial should be with the head in west looking eastward as is well known in england until the time of george iv it was the general practice to bury ,"['reckon', 'northern', 'glorious', 'tradition', 'scatter', 'shriek', 'flesh', 'tempt', 'natural', 'inspire', 'declare', 'indignation', 'god', 'law',

mall in two thousand seventeen i can t believe we fuckin lived this far to be here now you know and you ninjas you should be loud very very loud because you are the crowd you re the fucking crowd that deserves to be proud make some noise what up juggalos my name s shaggy i too have many more names but unlike my boy right here y all know my name so instead i wanna address you here today at the march

wheel spectrum the red lives the brown lives the white the green and the yellow lives to full breed lives to half breed lives and breed lives listen wh i believe that s inbred lives that s just how i say it cause i m inbred all tones from the pasty porcelain doll fluorescent mj bright tone lives to the midnight coal oil soaked void of light dark tone lives listenin to the transparent lives the

discriminate for nobody for nothin everybody s welcome under this big top yeah you should be loud because you re the crowd to be proud and right now we couldn t be possibly prouder than we am to have you very people right here representin us today right now here at the juggalo march on washington d c two thousand seventeen thank you mother fuckers be loud everybody this is the crowd to be proud yeah hell yeah you really should totally be proud of yourselves right now ninjas that s real talk if you can bend your backbones like shaggy can you should be up in one of them fuckin porta potties right now blowin yourself that s how proud you should be if it s too nasty up in there you should be up in one of one of these governmently landscape fine maple trees blowin yourself or playing the national anthem on your skin flute somethin just recognize how fuckin dope you are right now because you re here you re makin history and you know damn well in your hearts we re the good guys here today real shit you can feel it in your gut we re the good guys we re actually in the right this time if there s a holy creator and you know damn well we believe there is if there is a holy creator you know he s patting us on our head right now and not the way a horny uncle does his nephew when he does what he s told and keeps his mouth shut nothing like that but in the sense that we ve done good for ourselves and many many others who weren t as privileged as driven or as lucky to be here representing for them like we are right now i hope you ninjas remember this for the rest of your lives because it s worth doing just that for real this this issue this matter means that much to us as juggalos and we came here to do something about the problem and you should be proud of yourselves because the way i look at it each and every one of you ninjas and ninjettes probably represents twenty five thousand other ninjettes that s right i don t know what s going on i don t know where this is supposed to end with the feds i don t know if they see the juggalos as some sort of sheet or testing grounds if they get away with this what s next what s who s next in line but the thing is they re not gonna get past us they re not just gonna steamroll over juggalos fuck that you know maybe they looked at us and said man those are the world s most hated people supporting the world s most hated bands bumpin the world s most hated music they ll be an easy target once we once we officially silence them and shut their mouths that ll be our first step toward who knows what censorship all around fuckin brain control i don t know what but it ain t gonna happen it ain t goin down like that my friends i don t know if they had i don t know who they had set in their sights next macklemore i don t know but they ain t gonna meet whoever they had in their sights next because they awoke a sleeping giant and it s more than just juggalos that are pissed about this good america s actually pissed about this america s come farther than i think they realized a lot of people don t want discrimination in this country anymore man they don t want bullshit racism they don t want hate that shit s played out n ancient man and i have a feel i feel like today we re representin a lot of that bullshit we re representing the force against it so we re standin for a lot more than our own problem at hand because like i said if they get away with this if they roll right over us where exactly does it fuckin stop they don t want gays marryin each other they don t want fuckin people sayin whatever they want in public on microphones like this they don t want races goin to schools with each other they don t want rich minglin with poor all that played off fuckin bullshit it s two thousand seventeen i said seventeen people want freedom they want the right to make a choice they even want the right to smoke a little bit uh fuckin hog s breath martian grash if they want look around you it s happening laws are changing i thought things were going in a good direction and all of a sudden we took a giant leap backwards all of a sudden with this and i don t understand it at all but people ain t havin it more than just us more than just juggalos there s people here right now that aren t juggalos that don t know our music and don t give a fuck about us but they do give a fuck about injustice and discrimination let s give it up for them y all come on for them that s right yeah but we re making our presence felt as juggalos here right now and it goes much farther than what meets the eye right now they re watchin us all over the place all over the country all over the world in fact ninjas you re being heard right now be loud because you re the crowd to be proud and don t fuck up cause they re watchin that s right they re watchin us right now there s a feds there s a fed watchin you right now with your face on close up on his monitor that s right he s got your face blown up full screen on his monitor and he s got the screen in screen technology with a close up of your ass that s right and he s up in a fuckin one man satellite right up there and in front of him he s got controls that look like the old school atari i m not kiddin he s up there grippin a one man satellite and he s sittin in a highchair style baby seat pinched off tight as fuck just waitin to rain shit all over our fresh parade don t give em what they want don t be the criminals they re sayin we are in front of them don t be the thugs the vandals and the hoodlums they re claimin we are while they re lookin be careful be safe ninjas that s right ninjas this is our year we re here we re loud we re proud and as they re lookin at you with that close up on their monitor of your mug go ahead and mouth the words fuck you that s right and that screen in screen technology with the close up of your ass and for some reason their third monitor has a close up of psy s gangnam style video pulled up on youtube for some reason the point is they can t be explained if they could be explained what the fuck would be be on a gang list for none of it makes any sense so ignore the fuckin fruity fred fre ignore the fruity feds and ignore the fact they re watchin us have fun enjoy yourselves and be loud with proud pride dignity whoop whoop yeah the cool thing is what s beautiful is there actually is members of the media members in powerful branches of the press that actually have our back because they re not shallow they re not lookin at us for our latest album s quality or bullshit like that they re looking at simple blunt obvious cut and dry discrimination and they re screamin foul vice is here give it up for vice it s crazy but somehow time magazine has our back there s all sorts of media that are actually siding with us because they cry foul when they see it show em love juggalos whoop whoop yeah we need it that s right howard stern gots our back you know the bottom line is there s an issue at hand a very bold blatant issue we re discussing here and whether or not you detest or respect the juggalo subculture amazing and undeniable impact on america s high class fashion industry and the impact juggalos have on america s stylish trends that s not what we re discussing right now nor are were discussing nor are we discussing shaggy or my own extremely unbelievable prince like multi instrumental talents nor are we just having another three hour discussion of shaggy my brother s inhuman damn near supernatural pinpoint perfected marathon ballet style free style dancing skills that s not up for debate right now what is and what always has been up for debate is the only thing we ve cried about since discrimination fuck that what check it out i don t know about you i m not gay but i would fuckin march for the right for two gay people to marry each other if they wanted i would fuckin actually march for a redneck s right for his neck to be red i don t wanna take nobody s rights away for anything they want unless they wanna hurt or be foul hurt the feelings or walk around projecting negative energy there s no point for that but everybody s opinion is worth more than gold to me even if i it s not my opinion or shaggy s we still believe in the right to have an opinion taking away as you know taking away somebody s opinion is no different than sewing their butthole shut do you wanna sew a man s butthole shut i mean i might wanna watch what happens in fast forward but i don t wanna do the actual sewing the point is fuck discrimination right your turn so anyhow the issue we re addressing right now is however there s many americans who don t fuckin wanna see anymore played out nineteen sixty fuckin four old guard old money old wrinkly red neck whiskey throat bigot bitch boy richy dickhead douchery discrimination and its played out bullshit in our country anymore that good people the hardworking people the heart having free thinking moral minded people are demanding better treatment for each other on each other in this day and age in this day and age we re talkin about the united states government still doing this bullshit that s why you re here right now you re in the crowd to be proud you re the ones that ban in no discrimination why the fuck would anybody wanna be on the other side of this argument why where does the fbi s side of the argument end if it happens to juggalos if it and the government s th gets away with this commits such a blatant knock of discrimination against us juggalos then what the fuck happens to us next what happens to everybody next you never know what happens to jimmy buffett s parrotheads what happen to justin bitchboy bieber s little beliebers what happens to mariah carey s shit head sheep our guess is as good as yours but we ain t never gonna have to find out we re not gonna have to see the what kind of censorship bullshit the feds will put on american citiz necks because juggalos ain t gonna have get steamrolled over like that the juggalo family ain t gonna serve as the guinea pigs for this insanely ludicrous discin discrimination experiment on behalf of the feds fuck that we juggalos believe in all lives all nationalities all religions all sexual preferences all net worths all ages sizes education and anything other thing any other thing that separates us from each other whether you re talking about a woman s fuzzy neden hair from little peach fuzz to duck dynie length duck dynasty length beards it don t matter whether you re talking about the size of a man s butthole from pinky toe ring size to big pun s briefs r i p if a ninja has a soul then a ninja matters immensely everybody livin should mean the world to us and check this out the united states government should take a page from the dark carnival handbook on that shit right there it seems wisdom beats out over intelligence in almost every case intelligence is what you thought in your is what you re taught in your schools special classes and through training it s all very important but the simple fact yes yes i don t know how to do it wh what no no that s where i m at right and that s all very important but wisdom wisdom is the skill only living through life and being a servant can teach you wisdom is only earned by having feelings for fellow man trying your best to be a good person and being kind to one another on this incredible planet we share wisdom only comes from learning the best most efficient ways to make love not war through doing your best to spread karma and love to each other instead of spreading hurtful rumors and lies about each other wisdom is only earned by living life powered in committing good positive energy and actions to get yours what do you want more in life this is jumpin all around what do you want more in life intelligence or wisdom the gang s fbi assessment reports are all in people the federal burie bure the federal bureau of investigation s crazy mad intelligent profile experts have computed the information compounded within its extremely intelligent ba database system and it s uh and it s all been computed all of the program pr intelligence and the information and it s it s in its last it s in at last motherfucker ah alright i can t read and scroll you take it over that was some fuckin hellified reading right there tongue twisting that was fuckin very impressive check it out y all the fbi s intelligence is in and the database report is complete and it says juggalos are a loosely organized hybrid gang but check it out the juggalos and the dark carnival wisdom report is in as well and that report says two words fuck you that report says in the eyes of juggalos there s no such thing as a v i p we re all very important every fuckin human being is very important fuck your v i p juggalos it s simply put best by my brother jumpsteady i don t give a fuck what the intelligence says i don t give a fuck what the intelligence scholars teach the feds in law school intelligence is how to make a nuclear bomb but wisdom is how not to use it juggalos possess mad wisdom we re a family ninjas that s right and we got family at home we re marching for this may sound corny but it s real shit love always wins every time and we re marchin for love juggalo family love i don t know what the fuck they re marchin for i

m fortunate you believe in a dream this orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine and last night was just another distraction or a reaction of what we consider madness i know exactly what happened you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help held him like a newborn baby and made him feel like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up but the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will that s blood spilled on your hands my plan s rather vindictive everybody s a victim in my eyes when i ride it s a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black a demon glued to my back whispering get em i got em and i ain t give a fuck that same mentality i told my brother not to duck in actuality it s a trip how we trip off of colors i wonder if i ll ever discover a passion like you and recover the life that i knew as a youngin in pajamas and dun ta duns when thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb niggas like me never prosper prognosis of a problem child i m proud and well devoted this piru shit been in me forever so forever i ma push it wherever whenever and i love you cause you love my brother like you did just promise me you ll tell this story when you make it

last week this is the life of another girl damaged by the system these foster homes i run away and never do miss em see my hormones just run away and if i can get em back to where they used to be then i ll probably be in the denim of a family gene that show women how to be woman or better yet a leader you need her to learn somethin then you probably need to beat her that s how i was taught three niggas in one room first time i was tossed and i m exhausted but fuck that sorry for your loss shit my sister died in vain but what point are you tryna gain if you can t fit the pumps i walk in i ll wait your rebuttal a little too late and if you have a album date just make sure i m not in the song cause i don t need the attention bring enough of that on my own and matter fact did i mention that

verse sometimes i look in the mirror and ask myself am i really scared of passin away if it s today i hope i hear a cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon with the holy ghost til it drown in the blood of jesus i wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin the scent of a reaper ensurin that my allegiance with the other side may come soon and if i m doomed may the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons i suffer a lot and every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch i tie my stomach in knots and i m not sure why i m infatuated with death my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats that can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerful and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch maybe cause i m a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death really stuck in the schema of wonderin when i ma rest and you re right your brother was a brother to me and your sister s situation was the one that pulled me in a direction to speak on somethin that s realer than the tv screen by any means wasn t tryin to offend or come between her personal life i was like it need to be told cursin the life of twenty generations after her soul exactly what d happen if i ain t continue rappin or steady bein distracted by money drugs and s i count lives all on these songs look at the weak and cry pray one day you ll be strong fightin for your rights even when you re wrong and hope that at least one of you sing about me when i m gone am i worth it did i put enough work in chorus promise that you will sing about me promise that you will sing
