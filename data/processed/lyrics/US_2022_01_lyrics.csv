the guermantes as displayed before the princesse de parme a strange visit to m de charlus his character puzzles me more and more the red shoes of the duchess albeit it was simply a sunday in autumn i had been born again life lay intact before me for that morning after a succession of mild days there had been a cold mist which had not cleared until nearly midday a change in the weather is sufficient to create the world and oneself anew formerly when the wind howled in my chimney i would listen to the blows which it struck on the iron trap with as keen an emotion as if like the famous bow taps with which the c minor symphony opens they had been the irresistible appeal of a mysterious destiny every change in the aspect of nature offers us a similar transformation by adapting our desires so as to harmonise with the new form of things the mist from the moment of my awakening had made of me instead of the centrifugal being which one is on fine days a self centred man longing for the chimney corner and the nuptial couch a shivering adam in quest of a sedentary eve in this different world between the soft grey tint of a morning landscape and the taste of a cup of chocolate i tried to account for all the originality of the physical intellectual and moral life which i had taken with me about a year earlier to donci res and which blazoned with the oblong form of a bare hillside always present even when it was invisible formed in me a series of pleasures entirely distinct from all others incommunicable to my friends in the sense that the impressions richly interwoven with one another which gave them their orchestral accompaniment were a great deal more characteristic of them to my subconscious mind than any facts that i might have related from this point of view the new world in which the mist of this morning had immersed me was a world already known to me which only made it more real and forgotten for some time which restored all its novelty and i was able to look at several of the pictures of misty landscapes which my memory had acquired notably a series of mornings at donci res including my first morning there in barracks and another in a neighbouring country house where i had gone with saint loup to spend the night in which from the windows whose curtains i had drawn back at daybreak before getting into bed again in the first a trooper in the second on the thin margin of a pond and a wood all the rest of which was engulfed in the uniform and liquid softness of the mist a coachman busy polishing a strap had appeared to me like those rare figures scarcely visible to the eye obliged to adapt itself to the mysterious vagueness of their half lights which emerge from an obliterated fresco it was from my bed that i was looking this afternoon at these pictorial memories for i had gone back to bed to wait until the hour came at which taking advantage of the absence of my parents who had gone for a few days to combray i proposed to get up and go to a little play which was being given that evening in mme de villeparisis s drawing room had they been at home i should perhaps not have ventured to go out my mother in the delicacy of her respect for my grandmother s memory wished the tokens of regret that were paid to it to be freely and sincerely given she would not have forbidden me this outing she would have disapproved of it from combray on the other hand had i consulted her wishes she would not have replied in a melancholy do just as you like you are old enough now to know what is right or wrong but reproaching herself for having left me alone in paris and measuring my grief by her own would have wished for it distractions of a sort which she would have refused to herself and which she persuaded herself that my grandmother solicitous above all things for my health and the preservation of my nervous balance would have advised me to take that morning the furnace of the new steam heater had for the first time been lighted its disagreeable sound an intermittent hiccough had no part whatsoever in my memories of donci res but its prolonged encounter in me this afternoon with them was to give it so lasting an affinity with them that whenever after succeeding more or less in forgetting it i heard the central heater hiccough again it reminded me of them there was no one else in the house but fran oise the grey light falling like a fine rain on the earth wove without ceasing a transparent web through which the sunday holiday makers appeared in a silvery sheen i had flung to the foot of my bed the figaro for which i had been sending out religiously every morning ever since i had sent in an article which it had not yet printed despite the absence of the sun the intensity of the daylight was an indication that we were still only half way through the afternoon the tulle window curtains vaporous and friable as they would not have been on a fine day had that same blend of beauty and fragility that dragon flies wings have and venetian glass it depressed me all the more that i should be spending this sunday by myself because i had sent a note that morning to mlle de stermaria robert de saint loup whom his mother had at length succeeded in parting after painful and abortive attempts from his mistress and who immediately afterwards had been sent to morocco in the hope of his there forgetting one whom he had already for some little time ceased to love had sent me a line which had reached me the day before announcing his arrival presently in france for a short spell of leave as he would only be passing through paris where his family were doubtless afraid of seeing him renew relations with rachel he informed me to shew me that he had been thinking of me that he had met at tangier mile or rather mme for she had divorced her husband three months after their marriage de stermaria and robert remembering what i had told him at balbec had asked her on my behalf to arrange a meeting she would be delighted to dine with me she had told him on one of the evenings which before her return to brittany she would be spending in paris he warned me to lose no time in writing to mme de stermaria for she would certainly have arrived before i got his letter this had corne as no surprise to me even although i had had no news of him since at the time of my grandmother s last illness he had accused me of perfidy and treachery it had then been quite easy to see what must have happened rachel who liked to provoke his jealousy she had other reasons also for wishing me harm had persuaded her lover that i had made a dastardly attempt to have relations with her in his absence it is probable that he continued to believe in the truth of this allegation but he had ceased to be in love with her which meant that its truth or falsehood had become a matter of complete indifference to him and our friendship alone remained when on meeting him again i attempted to speak to him about his attack on me his sole answer was a cordial and friendly smile which gave him the air of begging my pardon then he turned the conversation to something else all this was not to say that he did not a little later see rachel occasionally when he was in paris the fellow creatures who have played a leading part in one s life very rarely disappear from it suddenly with any finality they return to take their old place in it at odd moments so much so as to lead people to believe in a renewal of old love before leaving it for ever saint loup s breach with rachel had very soon become less painful to him thanks to the soothing pleasure that was given him by her incessant demands for money jealousy which prolongs the course of love is not capable of containing many more ingredients than are the other forms of imagination if one takes with one when one starts on a journey three or four images which incidentally one is sure to lose on the way such as the lilies and anemones heaped on the ponte vecchio or the persian church shrouded in mist one s trunk is already pretty full when one parts from a mistress one would be just as glad until one has begun to forget her that she should not become the property of three or four potential protectors whom one has in one s mind s eye of whom that is to say one is jealous all those whom one does not so picture count for nothing now frequent demands for money from a cast off mistress no more give one a complete idea of her life than charts shewing a high temperature would of her illness but the latter would at any rate be an indication that she was ill and the former furnish a presumption vague enough it is true that the forsaken one or forsaker whichever she be cannot have found anything very remarkable in the way of rich protectors and so each demand is welcomed with the joy which a lull produces in the jealous one s sufferings while he responds to it at once by dispatching money for naturally he does not like to think of her being in want of anything except lovers one of the three lovers he has in his mind s eye until time has enabled him to regain his composure and he can learn without the slightest emotion the name of his successor sometimes rachel came in so late at night that she could ask her former lover s permission to lie down beside him until the morning this was a great comfort to robert for it refreshed his memory of how they had after all lived in intimacy together merely to see that even if he took the greater part of the bed for himself it did not in the least interfere with her sleep he realised that she was more comfortable lying close to his body than she would have been elsewhere that she felt herself by his side even in an hotel to be in a bedroom known of old in which the force of habit prevails and one sleeps better he felt that his shoulders his limbs all of him were for her even when he was unduly restless from sleeplessness or from having to get up in the night things so entirely usual that they could not disturb her and that the perception of them added still further to her sense of repose to revert to where we were i had been all the more disquieted by robert s letter in that i could read between the lines what he had not ventured to write more explicitly you can most certainly ask her to dine in a private room he told me she is a charming young person a delightful nature you will get on splendidly with her and i am sure you will have a capital evening together as my parents were returning at the end of the week on saturday or sunday and as after that i should be forced to dine every evening at home i had written at once to mme de stermaria proposing any evening that might suit her up to friday a message was brought back that i should hear from her in writing the same evening about eight o clock the time would have passed quickly enough if i had had during the afternoon that separated me from her letter the help of a visit from anyone else when the hours pass wrapped in conversation one ceases to count or indeed to notice them they vanish and suddenly it is a long way beyond the point at which it escaped you that there reappears the nimble truant time but if we are alone our preoccupation by bringing before us the still distant and incessantly awaited moment with the frequency and uniformity of a ticking pendulum divides or rather multiplies the hours by all the minutes which had we been with friends we should not have counted and confronted by the incessant return of my desire with the ardent pleasure which i was going to taste not for some days though alas in mme de stermaria s company this afternoon which i should have to spend by myself seemed to me very empty and very melancholy every now and then i heard the sound of the lift coming up but it was followed by a second sound not that for which i was hoping namely the sound of its coming to a halt at our landing but another very different sound which the lift made in continuing its progress to the floors above and which because it so often meant the desertion of my floor when i was expecting a visitor remained for me at other times even when i had no wish to see anyone a sound lugubrious in itself in which there echoed as it were a sentence of solitary confinement weary resigned busy for several hours still over its immemorial task the grey day stitched its shimmering needlework of light and shade and it saddened me to think that i was to be left alone with a thing that knew me no more than would a seamstress who installed by the window so as to see better while she finished her work paid no attention to the person present with her in the room suddenly although i had heard no bell fran oise opened the door to let in albertine who came forward smiling silent plump containing in the fulness of her body made ready so that i might continue living them come in search of me the days we had spent together at that balbec to which i had never since returned no doubt whenever we see again a person with whom our relations however trivial they may have been are altered it is like a juxtaposition of two different periods for this we do not require that a former mistress should come to call upon us as a friend all that we need is the visit to paris of a person whom we had known in the daily round of some particular kind of life and that this life should have ceased for us were it no more than a week ago on each of albertine s smiling questioning blushing features i could read the questions and madame de villeparisis and the dancing master and the pastry cook when she sat down her back seemed to be saying gracious there s no cliff here you don t mind if i sit down beside you all the same as i used to do at balbec she was like an enchantress handing me a mirror that reflected time in this she was like all the people whom we seldom see now but with whom at one time we lived on more intimate terms with al bertine however there was something more than this certainly even at balbec in our daily encounters i had always been surprised when she came in sight so variable was her appearance from day to day but now it was difficult to recognise her cleared of the pink vapour that used to bathe them her features had emerged like those of a statue she had another face or rather she had a face at last her body too had grown there remained scarcely anything now of the shell in which she had been enclosed and on the surface of which at balbec her future outline had been barely visible this time albertine had returned to paris earlier than usual as a rule she came only in the spring which meant that already disturbed for some weeks past by the storms that were beating down the first flowers i did not distinguish in the elements of the pleasure that i felt the return of albertine from that of the fine weather it was enough that i should be told that she was in paris and that she had called at the house for me to see her again like a rose flowering by the sea i cannot say whether it was the desire for balbec or for herself that overcame me at such moments possibly my desire for her was itself a lazy cowardly and incomplete method of possessing balbec as if to possess a thing materially to take up one s abode in a town were equivalent to possessing it spiritually besides even materially when she was no longer posed by my imagination before a horizon of sea but sitting still in a room with me she seemed to me often a very poor specimen of a rose so poor indeed that i would gladly have shut my eyes in order not to observe this or that blemish of its petals and to imagine instead that i was inhaling the salt air on the beach i must say it at this point albeit i was not then aware of what was to happen only later on certainly it is more reasonable to devote one s life to women than to postage stamps or old snuff boxes even to pictures or statues only the example of other collectors should be a warning to us to make changes to have not one woman only but several those charming suggestions in which a girl abounds of a sea beach of the braided hair of a statue in church of an old print of everything that makes one see and admire in her whenever she appears a charming composition those suggestions are not very stable live with a woman altogether and you will soon cease to see any of the things that made you love her though i must add that these two sundered elements can be reunited by jealousy if after a long period of life in common i was to end by seeing nothing more in albertine than an ordinary woman an intrigue between her and some person whom she had loved at balbec would still suffice perhaps to reincorporate in her to amalgamate the beach and the unrolling of the tide only as these secondary suggestions no longer captivate our eyes it is to the heart that they are perceptible and fatal we cannot under so dangerous a form regard the repetition of the miracle as a thing to be desired but i am anticipating the course of years and here i need only state my regret that i did not have the sense simply to have kept my collection of women as people keep their collections of old quizzing glasses never so complete in their cabinet that there is not room always for another and rarer still departing from the customary order of her holiday movements this year she had come straight from balbec where furthermore she had not stayed nearly so late as usual it was a long time since i had seen her and as i did not know even by name the people with whom she was in the habit of mixing in paris i could form no impression of her during the periods in which she abstained from coming to see me these lasted often for quite a time then one fine day in would burst albertine whose rosy apparitions and silent visits left me little if any better informed as to what she might have been doing in an interval which remained plunged in that darkness of her hidden life which my eyes felt little anxiety to pierce this time however certain signs seemed to indicate that some new experience must have entered into that life and yet perhaps all that one was entitled to conclude from them was that girls change very rapidly at the age which albertine had now reached for instance her intellect was now more in evidence and on my reminding her of the day when she had insisted with so much ardour on the superiority of her idea of making sophocles write my dear racine she was the first to laugh quite wholeheartedly at her own stupidity andr e was quite right it was stupid of me she admitted sophocles ought to have begun sir i replied that the sir and dear sir of andr e were no less comic than her own my dear racine or gis le s my dear friend but that after all the really stupid people were the professors who still went on making sophocles write letters to racine here however albertine was unable to follow me she could not see in what the silliness consisted her intelligence was dawning but had not fully developed there were other more attractive novelties in her i felt in this same pretty girl who had just sat down by my bed something that was different and in those lines which in one s eyes and other features express one s general attitude towards life a change of front a partial conversion as though there had now been shattered those resistances against which i had hurled my strength in vain at balbec one evening now remote in time on which we formed a couple symmetrical with but the converse of our present arrangement since then it had lieen she who was lying down and i who sat by her bedside wishing and not venturing to make certain whether now she would let herself be kissed every time that she rose to go i asked her to stay beside me a little longer this was a concession not very easy to obtain for albeit she had nothing to do otherwise she would have rushed from the house she was a person methodical in her habits and moreover not very gracious towards me scarcely to be at ease in my company and yet each time after looking at her watch she sat down again at my request until finally she had spent several hours with me without my having asked her for anything the things i was saying to her followed logically those that i had said during the hours before and bore no relation to what i was thinking about what i desired from her remained indefinitely parallel there is nothing like desire for preventing the thing one says from bearing any resemblance to what one has in one s mind time presses and yet it seems as though we were seeking to gain time by speaking of subjects absolutely alien to that by which we are obsessed we then arrange that the sentence which we should like to utter shall be accompanied or rather preluded by a gesture supposing that is to say that we have not to give ourselves the pleasure of an immediate demonstration and to gratify the curiosity we feel as to the reactions which will follow it without a word said without even a by your leave already made this gesture certainly i was not in the least in love with albertine child of the mists outside she could merely content the imaginative desire which the change of weather had awakened in me and which was midway between the desires that are satisfied by the arts of the kitchen and of monumental sculpture respectively for it made me dream simultaneously of mingling with my flesh a substance different and warm and of attaching at some point to my outstretched body a body divergent as the body of eve barely holds by the feet to the side of adam to whose body hers is almost perpendicular in those romanesque bas reliefs on the church at balbec which represent in so noble and so reposeful a fashion still almost like a classical frieze the creation of woman god in them is everywhere followed as by two ministers by two little angels in whom the visitor recognises like winged swarming summer creatures which winter has surprised and spared cupids from herculaneum still surviving well into the thirteenth century and winging their last slow flight weary but never failing in the grace that might be expected of them over the whole front of the porch as for this pleasure which by accomplishing my desire would have set me free from these meditations and which i should have sought quite as readily from any other pretty woman had i been asked upon what in the course of this endless flow of talk throughout which i took care to keep from albertine the one thing that was in my mind was based my optimistic hypothesis with regard to her possible complaisances i should perhaps have answered that this hypothesis was due while the forgotten outlines of albertine s voice retraced for me the contour of her personality to the apparition of certain words which did not form part of her vocabulary or at least not in the acceptation which she now gave them thus she said to roe that elstir was stupid and on my protesting you don t understand she replied smiling i mean that it was stupid of him to behave like that of course i know he s quite a distinguished person really similarly wishing to say of the fontainebleau golf club that it was smart she declared they are quite a selection speaking of a duel that i had fought she said of my seconds what very choice seconds and looking at my face confessed that she would like to see me wear a moustache she even went so far and my chance appeared then enormous as to announce in a phrase of which i would have sworn that she was ignorant a year earlier that since she had last seen gis le there had passed a certain lapse of time this was not to say that albertine had not already possessed when i was at balbec a quite adequate assortment of those expressions which reveal at once that one s people are in easy circumstances and which year by year a mother passes on to her daughter just as she bestows on her gradually as the girl grows up on important occasions her own jewels it was evident that albertine had ceased to be a little girl when one day to express her thanks for a present which a strange lady had given her she had said i am quite confused mme bontemps could not help looking across at her husband whose comment was gad she s old for fourteen the approach of nubility had been more strongly marked still when albertine speaking of another girl whose tone was bad said one can t even tell whether she s pretty she paints her face a foot thick finally though still a schoolgirl she already displayed the manner of a grown woman of her upbringing and station when she said of some one whose face twitched i can t look at him because it makes me want to do the same or if some one else were being imitated the absurd thing about it is that when you imitate her voice you look exactly like her all these are drawn from the social treasury but it did not seem to me possible that albertine s natural environment could have supplied her with distinguished used in the sense in which my father would say of a colleague whom he had not actually met but whose intellectual attainments he had heard praised it appears he s quite a distinguished person selection even when used of a golf club seemed to me as incompatible with the simonet family as it would be if preceded by the adjective natural with a text published centuries before the researches of darwin lapse of time struck me as being of better augury still finally there appeared the evidence of certain upheavals the nature of which was unknown to me but sufficient to justify me in all my hopes when albertine announced with the satisfaction of a person whose opinion is by no means to be despised you might also like to my mind that is the best thing that could possibly happen i regard it as the best solution the stylish way out this was so novel so manifestly an alluvial deposit giving one to suspect such capricious wanderings over soil hitherto unknown to her that on hearing the words to my mind i drew albertine towards me and at i regard made her sit on the side of my bed no doubt it does happen that women of moderate culture on marrying well read men receive such expressions as part of their paraphernalia and shortly after the metamorphosis which follows the wedding night when they begin to pay calls and talk shyly to the friends of their girlhood one notices with surprise that they have turned into matrons if in deciding that some person is intelligent they sound both l s in the word but that is precisely the sign of a change of state and i could see a difference when i thought of the vocabulary of the albertine i had known of old a vocabulary in which the most daring flights were to say of any unusual person he s a type or if you suggested a game of cards to her i ve no money to lose or again if any of her friends were to reproach her in terms which she felt to be undeserved that really is magnificent an expression dictated in such cases by a sort of middle class tradition almost as old as the magnificat itself and one which a girl slightly out of temper and confident that she is in the right employs as the saying is quite naturally that is to say because she has learned the words from her mother just as she has learned to say her prayers or to greet a friend all these expressions mme bontemps had imparted to her at the same time as her hatred of the jews and her feeling for black which was always suitable and becoming indeed without any formal instruction but as the piping of the parent goldfinches serves as a model for that of the young ones recently hatched so that they in turn grow into true goldfinches also but when all was said selection appeared to me of alien growth and i regard encouraging albertine was no longer the same which meant that she would not perhaps act would not react in the same way not only did i no longer feel any love for her but i had no longer to consider as i should have had at balbec the risk of shattering in her an affection for myself which no longer existed there could be no doubt that she had long since become quite indifferent to me i was well aware that to her i was in no sense a member now of the little band into which i had at one time so anxiously sought and had then been so happy to have secured admission besides as she had no longer even as in balbec days an air of frank good nature i felt no serious scruples still i believe that what made me finally decide was another philological discovery as continuing to add fresh links to the external chain of talk behind which i hid my intimate desire i spoke having albertine secure now on the corner of my bed of one of the girls of the little band one smaller than the rest whom nevertheless i had thought quite pretty yes answered albertine she reminds me of a little mousm there had been nothing in the world to shew when i first knew albertine that she had ever heard the wordmousm it was probable that had things followed their normal course she would never have learned it and for my part i should have seen no cause for regret in that for there is no more horrible word in the language the mere sound of it makes one s teeth ache as they do when one has put too large a spoonful of ice in one s mouth but coming from albertine as she sat there looking so pretty not even mousm could strike me as unpleasant on the contrary i felt it to be a revelation if not of an outward initiation at any rate of an inward evolution unfortunately it was now time for me to bid her good bye if i wished her to reach home in time for her dinner and myself to be out of bed and dressed in time for my own it was fran oise who was getting it ready she did not like having to keep it back and must already have found it an infringement of one of the articles of her code that albertine in the absence of my parents should be paying me so prolonged a visit and one which was going to make everything late but before mousm all these arguments fell to the ground and i hastened to say just fancy i m not in the least ticklish you can go on tickling me for an hour on end and i won t even feel it really i assure you she understood doubtless that this was the awkward expression of a desire on my part for like a person who offers to give you an introduction for which you have not ventured to ask him though what you have said has shewn him that it would be of great service to you would you like me to try she inquired with womanly meekness just as you like but you would be more comfortable if you lay down properly on the bed like that no get right on top you re sure i m not too heavy as she uttered these words the door opened and fran oise carrying a lamp came in albertine had just time to fling herself back upon her chair perhaps fran oise had chosen this moment to confound us having been listening at the door or even peeping through the keyhole but there was no need to suppose anything of the sort she might have scorned to assure herself by the use of her eyes of what her instinct must plainly enough have detected for by dint of living with me and my parents her fears her prudence her alertness her cunning had ended by giving her that instinctive and almost prophetic knowledge of us all that the mariner has of the sea the quarry of the hunter and of the malady if not the physician often at any rate the patient the amount of knowledge that she managed to acquire would have astounded a stranger and with as good reason as does the advanced state of certain arts and sciences among the ancients seeing that there was practically no source of information open to them her sources were no larger they were a few casual remarks forming barely a twentieth part of our conversation at dinner caught on the wing by the butler and inaccurately transmitted to the kitchen again her mistakes were due like theirs like the fables in which plato believed rather to a false conception of the world and to preconceived ideas than to the insufficiency of the materials at her disposal only the other day has it not been possible for the most important discoveries as to the habits of insects to be made by a scientist who had access to no laboratory and used no instruments of any sort but if the drawbacks arising from her menial position had not prevented her from acquiring a stock of learning indispensable to the art which was its ultimate goal and which consisted in putting us to confusion by communicating to us the results of her discoveries the limitations under which she worked had done more in this case the impediment not content with merely not paralysing the flight of her imagination had greatly strengthened it of course fran oise never let slip any artificial device those

consigo pero un a o tras otro como a un monasterio en el aire nuevos p jaros acud an a l en busca de abrigo hoy violentos vientos cruzan como una estampida de almas sacudiendo el rbol calvo y fam lico que danza y se dobla pero en el centro engastado en sus ramas como un enorme coraz n de mimbre se aferra la hermosa obra qu genial arquitecto erigi tan perfecta escultura que por m s que el tiempo intenta desdibujarla perdura y perdura ese mismo tiempo barri tambi n mi tristeza seren mi pas n y desgaj el rencor pero no su carga pues una bandada de negros recuerdos vuelve para desenterrar del

sendas del abismo como caminos hacia la armon a pero al penetrar en la lejan a todo apareci como un espejismo cuanta mayor soledad y mutismo dentro m s alto el grito todav a recorrer el mundo como un mendigo o huir del hombre como un animal no fue una redenci n sino un castigo sin un renacimiento espiritual de nada le sirve al ser huir del mal l es el mal y arrastra el mal consigo vii sed de tu carne rafael lechowski a sus espaldas la casa y el rbol delante un camino luminoso me obstin en olvidarte pero al alejarme de ti en el camino me hice m s peque o y t cada vez m s grande pero ya no tengo sed de tu carne conforme mi interior se llenaba de luz iba palideciendo tu imagen las flores dejaron de exhalar tu aroma el propio dolor ha dragado el recuerdo y el silencio ha dejado de hablarme ya no tengo sed de tu carne y no por ello te amo menos ahora te amo m s todav a si cabe igual que lo amo a l pues amo al mundo como una sola vida al universo como un enorme coraz n palpitante ya no tengo sed de tu carne del desamor sal con vida pero de este amor nuevo que nada me salve viii renunciaci n rafael lechowski hoy amanec llorando fue un llorar tan bello claro puro calmo ahora

agua y nuestro esp ritu sed y en mi sed de deseo deseo con la sed del pez fluir sin rumbo no hay mayor conquistador que aquel que ha sido conquistado por el mundo toda vida es prestada comprender que se es nada en medio de todo a la vez que todo en medio de nada el silencio es espejo y mi meditaci n un cielo donde mis pensamientos cruzan como aves por el aire quieto siento que despego que me elevo huyendo del apego del ego y del erebo del deseo ciego porque vivir errando de deseo en deseo no fue sino intentar calmar el dolor con un dolor nuevo la experiencia no es adquirir es despojarse y ahora llueve y llueve y veo el agua mojarse ix vac o y verdad rafael lechowski el intelecto es un instrumento demasiado complejo para comprender la sencillez de todo lo que es cierto s lo el desprendimiento espont neo del pensamiento permite al ser por momentos latir al un sono con el universo la mente es un pez sediento que busca fuera lo que est dentro la conciencia es el combate de los opuestos quisiera traducir lo que siento pero las palabras forman un r o de ruido cuando lo intento pero aquello que uno sabe sin saber lo que no puede explicar puede ser su mayor descubrimiento y hoy comprendo para qu sirve el vac o interior para hacerle espacio a la verdad en su alumbramiento x ca da del yo rafael lechowski llevaba mucho en recogimiento largu sima soledad sin apenas di logo ni pensamiento una vida reducida a despertar para cerrar los ojos de nuevo hincar el cuerpo en la tierra y respirar silencio comer escaso despacio pasear hasta el cansancio impasible a la ansiedad del tiempo descender al pueblo a por alimentos sorber el sol del camino volver por la senda del agradecimiento y de regreso espiar a trav s de las celos as con triste alegr a la fiesta en los jardines de las familias triste por mi soledad y feliz porque el universo es mi jard n y esas familias son tambi n las m as pero un d a despert sordo a lo externo mis ojos s lo pod an mirar hacia adentro y busqu dentro m s adentro y hall el centro el originario hilo que une al ser con el universo entonces sent un temblor como si cediesen los pretiles y pude asomarme m s a mi interior dentro todo era abismo voluta de oscuridad y precipicio y en la profundidad se o an gritos chillidos de una lucha encarnizada en lo m s hondo eran mis m ltiples yoes devor ndose unos a otros egos royendo a otros egos desfallecidos sobre el yermo los o a desgarrar y mascar deprisa hambrientos despedazando con avidez ojos v scera y huesos mientras otros buscaban en los escombros posibles restos desierto de carro a y piel de avatares muertos entra a y costra polvo y m scara de mis ancestros todo lo que fui y en verdad no era palacio en el aire ceguera la mentira de mis opuestos y qued un ltimo yo arraigado y gigantesco arrasado el pasto comenz a engullir sus propios miembros y no no era un sue o pues abr a fuerte los ojos y mareado ve a borroso el paisaje externo la casa el rbol el pozo el huerto y dentro pensamientos chocando contra pensamientos de pronto un cegador estruendo insoportable presi n en mi mente como si me arrancaran de mi propio cuerpo y se hizo el silencio finalmente mi conciencia un

the answer they want before we get going we need to establish one thing beyond any doubt industry funded trials are more likely to produce a positive flattering result than independently funded trials this is our core premise and you re about to read a very short chapter because this is one of the most well documented phenomena in the growing field of research about research it has also become much easier to study in recent years because the rules on declaring industry funding have become a little clearer we can begin with some recent work in three researchers from harvard and toronto found all the trials looking at five major classes of drug antidepressants ulcer drugs and so on then measured two key features were they positive and were they funded by industry they found over five hundred trials in total per cent of the industry funded studies were positive but only per cent of the government funded trials were that s a very significant difference in researchers looked at every published trial that set out to explore the benefit of a statin these are cholesterol lowering drugs which reduce your risk of having a heart attack they are prescribed in very large quantities and they will loom large in this book this study found trials in total either comparing one statin against another or comparing a statin against a different kind of treatment once the researchers controlled for other factors we ll delve into what this means later they found that industry funded trials were twenty times more likely to give results favouring the test drug again that s a very big difference we ll do one more in researchers looked into every trial of psychiatric drugs in four academic journals over a ten year period finding trial outcomes in total industry sponsors got favourable outcomes for their own drug per cent of the time while independently funded trials only gave a positive result in per cent of cases if you were a competing drug put up against the sponsor s drug in a trial you were in for a pretty rough ride you would only win a measly per cent of the time these are dismal frightening results but they come from individual studies when there has been lots of research in a field it s always possible that someone like me for example could cherry pick the results and give a partial view i could in essence be doing exactly what i accuse the pharmaceutical industry of doing and only telling you about the studies that support my case while hiding the reassuring ones from you to guard against this risk researchers invented the systematic review we ll explore this in more detail soon p since it s at the core of modern medicine but in essence a systematic review is simple instead of just mooching through the research literature consciously or unconsciously picking out papers here and there that support your pre existing beliefs you take a scientific systematic approach to the very process of looking for scientific evidence ensuring that your evidence is as complete and representative as possible of all the research that has ever been done systematic reviews are very very onerous in by coincidence two were published both looking specifically at the question we re interested in they took all the studies ever published that looked at whether industry funding is associated with pro industry results each took a slightly different approach to finding research papers and both found that industry funded trials were overall about four times more likely to report positive results a further review in looked at the new studies that had been published in the four years after these two earlier reviews it found twenty more pieces of work and all but two showed that industry sponsored trials were more likely to report flattering results i am setting out this evidence at length because i want to be absolutely clear that there is no doubt on the issue industry sponsored trials give favourable results and that is not my opinion or a hunch from the occasional passing study this is a very well documented problem and it has been researched extensively without anybody stepping out to take effective action as we shall see there is one last study i d like to tell you about it turns out that this pattern of industry funded trials being vastly more likely to give positive results persists even when you move away from published academic papers and look instead at trial reports from academic conferences where data often appears for the first time in fact as we shall see sometimes trial results only appear at an academic conference with very little information on how the study was conducted fries and krishnan studied all the research abstracts presented at the american college of rheumatology meetings which reported any kind of trial and acknowledged industry sponsorship in order to find out what proportion had results that favoured the sponsor s drug there is a small punch line coming and to understand it we need to cover a little of what an academic paper looks like in general the results section is extensive the raw numbers are given for each outcome and for each possible causal factor but not just as raw figures the ranges are given subgroups are perhaps explored statistical tests are conducted and each detail of the result is described in table form and in shorter narrative form in the text explaining the most important results this lengthy process is usually spread over several pages in fries and krishnan this level of detail was unnecessary the results section is a single simple and i like to imagine fairly passive aggressive sentence the results from every rct out of favored the drug of the sponsor this extreme finding has a very interesting side effect for those interested in time saving shortcuts since every industry sponsored trial had a positive result that s all you d need to know about a piece of work to predict its outcome if it was funded by industry you could know with absolute certainty that the trial found the drug was great how does this happen how do industry sponsored trials almost always manage to get a positive result it is as far as anyone can be certain a combination of factors it may be that companies are more likely to run trials when they re more confident their treatment is going to win this sounds reasonable although even this conflicts with the ethical principle that you should only do a trial when there s genuine uncertainty about which treatment is best otherwise you re exposing half of your participants to a treatment you already know to be inferior sometimes the chances of one treatment winning can be increased with outright design flaws you can compare your new drug with something you know to be rubbish an existing drug at an inadequate dose perhaps or a placebo sugar pill that does almost nothing you can choose your patients very carefully so they are more likely to get better on your treatment you can peek at the results halfway through and stop your trial early if they look good which is for interesting reasons we shall discuss statistical poison and so on but before we get to these fascinating methodological twists and quirks these nudges and bumps that stop a trial from being a fair test of whether a treatment works or not there is something very much simpler at hand sometimes drug companies conduct lots of trials and when they see that the results are unflattering they simply fail to publish them this is not a new problem and it s not limited to medicine in fact this issue of negative results that go missing in action cuts into almost every corner of science it distorts findings in fields as diverse as brain imaging and economics it makes a mockery of all our efforts to exclude bias from our studies and despite everything that regulators drug companies and even some academics will tell you it is a problem that has been left unfixed for decades in fact it is so deep rooted that even if we fixed it today right now for good forever without any flaws or loopholes in our legislation that still wouldn t help because we would still be practising medicine cheerfully making decisions about which treatment is best on the basis of decades of medical evidence which is as you ve now seen fundamentally distorted but there is a way ahead why missing data matters reboxetine is a drug i myself have prescribed other drugs had done nothing for this particular patient so we wanted to try something new i d read the trial data before i wrote the prescription and found only well designed fair tests with overwhelmingly positive results reboxetine was better than placebo and as good as any other antidepressant in head to head comparisons it s approved for use by the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency the mhra which governs all drugs in the uk millions of doses are prescribed every year around the world reboxetine was clearly a safe and effective treatment the patient and i discussed the evidence briefly and agreed it was the right treatment to try next i signed a piece of paper a prescription saying i wanted my patient to have this drug but we had both been misled in october a group of researchers were finally able to bring together all the trials that had ever been conducted on reboxetine through a long process of investigation searching in academic journals but also arduously requesting data from the manufacturers and gathering documents from regulators they were able to assemble all the data both from trials that were published and from those that had never appeared in academic papers when all this trial data was put together it produced a shocking picture seven trials had been conducted comparing reboxetine against placebo only one conducted in patients had a neat positive result and that one was published in an academic journal for doctors and researchers to read but six more trials were conducted in almost ten times as many patients all of them showed that reboxetine was no better than a dummy sugar pill none of these trials was published i had no idea they existed it got worse the trials comparing reboxetine against other drugs showed exactly the same picture three small studies patients in total showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other drug they were all published but patients worth of data was left unpublished and this unpublished data showed that patients on reboxetine did worse than those on other drugs if all this wasn t bad enough there was also the side effects data the drug looked fine in the trials which appeared in the academic literature but when we saw the unpublished studies it turned out that patients were more likely to have side effects more likely to drop out of taking the drug and more likely to withdraw from the trial because of side effects if they were taking reboxetine rather than one of its competitors if you re ever in any doubt about whether the stories in this book make me angry and i promise you whatever happens i will keep to the data and strive to give a fair picture of everything we know you need only look at this story i did everything a doctor is supposed to do i read all the papers i critically appraised them i understood them i discussed them with the patient and we made a decision together based on the evidence in the published data reboxetine was a safe and effective drug in reality it was no better than a sugar pill and worse it does more harm than good as a doctor i did something which on the balance of all the evidence harmed my patient simply because unflattering data was left unpublished if you find that amazing or outrageous your journey is just beginning because nobody broke any law in that situation reboxetine is still on the market and the system that allowed all this to happen is still in play for all drugs in all countries in the world negative data goes missing for all treatments in all areas of science the regulators and professional bodies we would reasonably expect to stamp out such practices have failed us in a few pages we will walk through the literature that demonstrates all of this beyond any doubt showing that publication bias the process whereby negative results go unpublished is endemic throughout the whole of medicine and academia and that regulators have failed to do anything about it despite decades of data showing the size of the problem but before we get to that research i need you to feel its implications so we need to think about why missing data matters evidence is the only way we can possibly know if something works or doesn t work in medicine we proceed by testing things as cautiously as we can in head to head trials and gathering together all of the evidence this last step is crucial if i withhold half the data from you it s very easy for me to convince you of something that isn t true if i toss a coin a hundred times for example but only tell you about the results when it lands heads up i can convince you that this is a two headed coin but that doesn t mean i really do have a two headed coin it means i m misleading you and you re a fool for letting me get away with it this is exactly the situation we tolerate in medicine and always have researchers are free to do as many trials as they wish and then choose which ones to publish the repercussions of this go way beyond simply misleading doctors about the benefits and harms of interventions for patients and way beyond trials medical research isn t an abstract academic pursuit it s about people so every time we fail to publish a piece of research we expose real living people to unnecessary avoidable suffering tgn in march six volunteers arrived at a london hospital to take place in a trial it was the first time a new drug called tgn had ever been given to humans and they were paid each within an hour these six men developed headaches muscle aches and a feeling of unease then things got worse high temperatures restlessness periods of forgetting who and where they were soon they were shivering flushed their pulses racing their blood pressure falling then a cliff one went into respiratory failure the oxygen levels in his blood falling rapidly as his lungs filled with fluid nobody knew why another dropped his blood pressure to just stopped breathing properly and was rushed to an intensive care unit knocked out intubated mechanically ventilated within a day all six were disastrously unwell fluid on their lungs struggling to breathe their kidneys failing their blood clotting uncontrollably throughout their bodies and their white blood cells disappearing doctors threw everything they could at them steroids antihistamines immune system receptor blockers all six were ventilated on intensive care they stopped producing urine they were all put on dialysis their blood was replaced first slowly then rapidly they needed plasma red cells platelets the fevers continued one developed pneumonia and then the blood stopped getting to their peripheries their fingers and toes went flushed then brown then black and then began to rot and die with heroic effort all escaped at least with their lives the department of health convened an expert scientific group to try to understand what had happened and from this two concerns were raised firstly can we stop things like this from happening again it s plainly foolish for example to give a new experimental treatment to all six participants in a first in man trial at the same time if that treatment is a completely unknown quantity new drugs should be given to participants in a staggered process slowly over a day this idea received considerable attention from regulators and the media less noted was a second concern could we have foreseen this disaster tgn is a molecule that attaches to a receptor called cd on the white blood cells of the immune system it was a new and experimental treatment and it interfered with the immune system in ways that are poorly understood and hard to model in animals unlike say blood pressure because immune systems are very variable between different species but as the final report found there was experience with a similar intervention it had simply not been published one researcher presented the inquiry with unpublished data on a study he had conducted in a single human subject a full ten years earlier using an antibody that attached to the cd cd and cd receptors the effects of this antibody had parallels with those of tgn and the subject on whom it was tested had become unwell but nobody could possibly have known that because these results were never shared with the scientific community they sat unpublished unknown when they could have helped save six men from a terrifying destructive avoidable ordeal that original researcher could not foresee the specific harm he contributed to and it s hard to blame him as an individual because he operated in an academic culture where leaving data unpublished was regarded as completely normal the same culture exists today the final report on tgn concluded that sharing the results of all first in man studies was essential they should be published every last one as a matter of routine but phase trial results weren t published then and they re still not published now in for the first time a study was published looking specifically at how many of these first in man trials get published and how many remain hidden they took all such trials approved by one ethics committee over a year after four years nine out of ten remain unpublished after eight years four out of five were still unpublished in medicine as we shall see time and again research is not abstract it relates directly to life death suffering and pain with every one of these unpublished studies we are potentially exposed quite unnecessarily to another tgn even a huge international news story with horrific images of young men brandishing blackened feet and hands from hospital beds wasn t enough to get movement because the issue of missing data is too complicated to fit in one sentence when we don t share the results of basic research such as a small first in man study we expose people to unnecessary risks in the future was this an extreme case is the problem limited to early experimental new drugs in small groups of trial participants no in the s doctors began giving anti arrhythmic drugs to all patients who d had a heart attack this practice made perfect sense on paper we knew that anti arrhythmic drugs helped prevent abnormal heart rhythms we also knew that people who ve had a heart attack are quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms we also knew that often these went unnoticed undiagnosed and untreated giving anti arrhythmic drugs to everyone who d had a heart attack was a simple sensible preventive measure unfortunately it turned out that we were wrong this prescribing practice with the best of intentions on the best of principles actually killed people and because heart attacks are very common it killed them in very large numbers well over people died unnecessarily before it was realised that the fine balance between benefit and risk was completely different for patients without a proven abnormal heart rhythm could anyone have predicted this sadly yes they could have a trial in tested a new anti arrhythmic drug lorcainide in a small number of men who d had a heart attack less than a hundred to see if it was any use nine out of forty eight men on lorcainide died compared with one out of forty seven on placebo the drug was early in its development cycle and not long after this study it was dropped for commercial reasons because it wasn t on the market nobody even thought to publish the trial the researchers assumed it was an idiosyncrasy of their molecule and gave it no further thought if they had published we would have been much more cautious about trying other anti arrhythmic drugs on people with heart attacks and the phenomenal death toll over people in their graves prematurely might have been stopped sooner more than a decade later the researchers finally did publish their results with a mea culpa recognising the harm they had done by not sharing them earlier when we carried out our study in we thought that the increased death rate that occurred in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance the development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons and this study was therefore never published it is now a good example of publication bias the results described here might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead as we shall shortly see this problem of unpublished data is widespread throughout medicine and indeed the whole of academia even though the scale of the problem and the harm it causes have been documented beyond any doubt we will see stories on basic cancer research tamiflu cholesterol blockbusters obesity drugs antidepressants and more with evidence that goes from the dawn of medicine to the present day and data that is still being withheld right now as i write on widely used drugs which many of you reading this book will have taken this morning we will also see how regulators and academic bodies have repeatedly failed to address the problem because researchers are free to bury any result they please patients are exposed to harm on a staggering scale throughout the whole of medicine from research to practice doctors can have no idea about the true effects of the treatments they give does this drug really work best or have i simply been deprived of half the data nobody can tell is this expensive drug worth the money or have the data simply been massaged no one can tell will this drug kill patients is there any evidence that it s dangerous no one can tell this is a bizarre situation to arise in medicine a discipline where everything is supposed to be based on evidence and where everyday practice is bound up in medico legal anxiety in one of the most regulated corners of human conduct we ve taken our eyes off the ball and allowed the evidence driving practice to be polluted and distorted it seems unimaginable we will now see how deep this problem goes why we summarise data missing data has been studied extensively in medicine but before i lay out that evidence we need to understand exactly why it matters from a scientific perspective and for that we need to understand systematic reviews and meta analysis between them these are two of the most powerful ideas in modern medicine they are incredibly simple but they were invented shockingly late when we want to find out if something works or not we do a trial this is a very simple process and the first recorded attempt at some kind of trial was in the bible daniel if you re interested firstly you need an unanswered question for example does giving steroids to a woman delivering a premature baby increase the chances of that baby surviving then you find some relevant participants in this case mothers about to deliver a premature baby you ll need a reasonable number of them let s say two hundred for this trial then you divide them into two groups at random give the mothers in one group the current best treatment whatever that is in your town while the mothers in the other group get current best treatment plus some steroids finally when all two hundred women have gone through your trial you count up how many babies survived in each group this is a real world question and lots of trials were done on this topic starting from onwards two trials showed that steroids saved lives but five showed no significant benefit now you will often hear that doctors disagree when the evidence is mixed and this is exactly that kind of situation a doctor with a strong pre existing belief that steroids work perhaps preoccupied with some theoretical molecular mechanism by which the drug might do something useful in the body could come along and say look at these two positive trials of course we must give steroids a doctor with a strong prior intuition that steroids were rubbish might point at the five negative trials and say overall the evidence shows no benefit why take a risk up until very recently this was basically how medicine progressed people would write long languorous review articles essays surveying the literature in which they would cite the trial data they d come across in a completely unsystematic fashion often reflecting their own prejudices and values then in the s people began to do something called a systematic review this is a clear systematic survey of the literature with the intention of getting all the trial data you can possibly find on one topic without being biased towards any particular set of findings in a systematic review you describe exactly how you looked for data which databases you searched which search engines and indexes you used even what words you searched for you pre specify the kinds of studies that can be included in your review and then you present everything you ve found including the papers you rejected with an explanation of why by doing this you ensure that your methods are fully transparent replicable and open to criticism providing the reader with a clear and complete picture of the evidence it may sound like a simple idea but systematic reviews are extremely rare outside clinical medicine and are quietly one of the most important and transgressive ideas of the past forty years when you ve got all the trial data in one place you can conduct something called a meta analysis where you bring all the results together in one giant spreadsheet pool all the data and get one single summary figure the most accurate summary of all the data on one clinical question the output of this is called a blobbogram and you can see one on the opposite page in the logo of the cochrane collaboration a global non profit academic organisation that has been producing gold standard reviews of evidence on important questions in medicine since the s this blobbogram shows the results of all the trials done on giving steroids to help premature babies survive each horizontal line is a trial if that line is further to the left then the trial showed steroids were beneficial and saved lives the central vertical line is the line of no effect and if the horizontal line of the trial touches the line of no effect then that trial showed no statistically significant benefit some trials are represented by longer horizontal lines these were smaller trials with fewer participants which means they are prone to more error so the estimate of the benefit has more uncertainty and therefore the horizontal line is longer finally the diamond at the bottom shows the summary effect this is the overall benefit of the intervention pooling together the results of all the individual trials these are much narrower than the lines for individual trials because the estimate is much more accurate it is summarising the effect of the drug in many more patients on this blobbogram you can see because the diamond is a long way from the line of no effect that giving steroids is hugely beneficial in fact it reduces the chances of a premature baby dying by almost half the amazing thing about this blobbogram is that it had to be invented and this happened very late in medicine s history for many years we had all the information we needed to know that steroids saved lives but nobody knew they were effective because nobody did a systematic review until as a result the treatment wasn t given widely and huge numbers of babies died unnecessarily not because we didn t have the information but simply because we didn t synthesise it together properly in case you think this is an isolated case it s worth examining exactly how broken medicine was until frighteningly recent times the diagram on the opposite page contains two blobbograms or forest plots showing all the trials ever conducted to see whether giving streptokinase a clot busting drug improves survival in patients who have had a heart attack look first only at the forest plot on the left this is a conventional forest plot from an academic journal so it s a little busier than the stylised one in the cochrane logo the principles however are exactly the same each horizontal line is a trial and you can see that there is a hodgepodge of results with some trials showing a benefit they don t touch the vertical line of no effect headed and some showing no benefit they do cross that line at the bottom however you can see the summary effect a dot on this old fashioned blobbogram rather than a diamond and you can see very clearly that overall streptokinase saves lives so what s that on the right it s something called a cumulative meta analysis if you look at the list of studies on the left of the diagram you can see that they are arranged in order of date the cumulative meta analysis on the right adds in each new trial s results as they arrived over history to the previous trials results this gives the best possible running estimate each year of how the evidence would have looked at that time if anyone had bothered to do a meta analysis on all the data available to them from this cumulative blobbogram you can see that the horizontal lines the summary effects narrow over time as more and more data is collected and the estimate of the overall benefit of this treatment becomes more accurate you can also see that these horizontal lines stopped touching the vertical line of no effect a very long time ago and crucially they do so a long time before we started giving streptokinase to everyone with a heart attack in case you haven t spotted it for yourself already to be fair the entire medical profession was slow to catch on this chart has devastating implications heart attacks are an incredibly common cause of death we had a treatment that worked and we had all the information we needed to know that it worked but once again we didn t bring it together systematically to get that correct answer half of the people in those trials at the bottom of the blobbogram were randomly assigned to receive no streptokinase i think unethically because we had all the information we needed to know that streptokinase worked they were deprived of effective treatments but they weren t alone because so were most of the rest of the people in the world at the time these stories illustrate i hope why systematic reviews and meta analyses are so important we need to bring together all of the evidence on a question not just cherry pick the bits that we stumble upon or intuitively like the look of mercifully the medical profession has come to recognise this over the past couple of decades and systematic reviews with meta analyses are now used almost universally to ensure that we have the most accurate possible summary of all the trials that have been done on a particular medical question but these stories also demonstrate why missing trial results are so dangerous if one researcher or doctor cherry picks when summarising the existing evidence and looks only at the trials that support their hunch then they can produce a misleading picture of the research that is a problem for that one individual and for anyone who is unwise or unlucky enough to be influenced by them but if we are all missing the negative trials the entire medical and academic community around the world then when we pool the evidence to get the best possible view of what works as we must do we are all completely misled we get a misleading impression of the treatment s effectiveness we incorrectly exaggerate its benefits or perhaps even find incorrectly that an intervention was beneficial when in reality it did harm now that you understand the importance of systematic reviews you can see why missing data matters but you can also appreciate that when i explain how much trial data is missing i am giving you a clean overview of the literature because i will be explaining that evidence using systematic reviews how much data is missing if you want to prove that trials have been left unpublished you have an interesting problem you need to prove the existence of studies you don t have access to to work around this people have developed a simple approach you identify a group of trials you know have been conducted and completed then check to see if they have been published finding a list of completed trials is the tricky part of this job and to achieve it people have used various strategies trawling the lists of trials that have been approved by ethics committees or institutional review boards in the usa for example or chasing up the trials discussed by researchers at conferences in a group of researchers decided to check for publication of every trial that had ever been reported to the us food and drug administration for all the

light before she came in it was in the darkness barely guided by the glow of a smouldering log that she lay down by my side my hands my cheeks alone identified her without my eyes beholding her my eyes that often were afraid of finding her altered with the result that by virtue of this unseeing love she may have felt herself bathed in a warmer affection than usual on other evenings i undressed i lay down and with albertine perched on the side of my bed we resumed our game or our conversation interrupted by kisses and in the desire that alone makes us take an interest in the existence and character of another person we remain so true to our own nature even if at the same time we abandon successively the different people whom we have loved in turn that on one occasion catching sight of myself in the glass at the moment when i was kissing albertine and calling her my little girl the sorrowful passionate expression on my own face similar to the expression it had assumed long ago with gilberte whom i no longer remembered and would perhaps assume one day with another girl if i was fated ever to forget albertine made me think that over and above any personal considerations instinct requiring that we consider the person of the moment as the only true person i was performing the duties of an ardent and painful devotion dedicated as an oblation to the youth and beauty of woman and yet with this desire honouring youth with an ex voto with my memories also of balbec there was blended in the need that i felt of keeping albertine in this way every evening by my side something that had hitherto been unknown at least in my amorous existence if it was not entirely novel in my life it was a soothing power the like of which i had not known since the evenings at combray long ago when my mother stooping over my bed brought me repose in a kiss to be sure i should have been greatly astonished at that time had anyone told me that i was not wholly virtuous and more astonished still to be told that i would ever seek to deprive some one else of a pleasure i must have known myself very slightly for my pleasure in having albertine to live with me was much less a positive pleasure than that of having withdrawn from the world where everyone was free to enjoy her in turn the blossoming damsel who if she did not bring me any great joy was at least withholding joy from others ambition fame would have left me unmoved even more was i incapable of feeling hatred and yet to me to love in a carnal sense was at any rate to enjoy a triumph over countless rivals i can never repeat it often enough it was first and foremost a sedative for all that i might before albertine returned have doubted her loyalty have imagined her in the room at montjouvain once she was in her dressing gown and seated facing my chair or if as was more frequent i had remained in bed at the foot of my bed i would deposit my doubts in her hand them over for her to relieve me of them with the abnegation of a worshipper uttering his prayer all the evening she might have been there huddled in a provoking ball upon my bed playing with me like a great cat her little pink nose the tip of which she made even tinier with a coquettish glance which gave it that sharpness which we see in certain people who are inclined to be stout might have given her a fiery and rebellious air she might have allowed a tress of her long dark hair to fall over a cheek of rosy wax and half shutting her eyes unfolding her arms have seemed to be saying to me do with me what you please when as the time came for her to leave me she drew nearer to say good night it was a meekness that had become almost a part of my family life that i kissed on either side of her firm throat which now never seemed to me brown or freckled enough as though these solid qualities had been in keeping with some loyal generosity in albertine when it was albertine s turn to bid me good night kissing me on either side of my throat her hair caressed me like a wing of softly bristling feathers incomparable as were those two kisses of peace albertine slipped into my mouth making me the gift of her tongue like a gift of the holy spirit conveyed to me a viaticum left me with a provision of tranquillity almost as precious as when my mother in the evening at combray used to lay her lips upon my brow are you coming with us to morrow you naughty man she asked before leaving me where are you going that will depend on the weather and on yourself but have you written anything to day my little darling no then it was hardly worth your while not coming with us tell me by the way when i came in you knew my step you guessed at once who it was of course could i possibly be mistaken couldn t i tell my little sparrow s hop among a thousand she must let me take her shoes off before she goes to bed it will be such a pleasure to me you are so nice and pink in all that white lace such was my answer among the sensual expressions we may recognise others that were peculiar to my grandmother and mother for little by little i was beginning to resemble all my relatives my father who in a very different fashion from myself no doubt for if things do repeat themselves it is with great variations took so keen an interest in the weather and not my father only i was becoming more and more like my aunt l onie otherwise albertine could not but have been a reason for my going out of doors so as not to leave her by herself beyond my control my aunt l onie wrapped up in her religious observances with whom i could have sworn that i had not a single point in common i so passionately keen on pleasure apparently worlds apart from that maniac who had never known any pleasure in her life and lay mumbling her rosary all day long i who suffered from my inability to embark upon a literary career whereas she had been the one person in the family who could never understand that reading was anything more than an amusing pastime which made reading even at the paschal season lawful upon sunday when every serious occupation is forbidden in order that the day may be hallowed by prayer alone now albeit every day i found an excuse in some particular indisposition which made me so often remain in bed a person not albertine not any person that i loved but a person with more power over me than any beloved had migrated into me despotic to the extent of silencing at times my jealous suspicions or at least of preventing me from going to find out whether they had any foundation and this was my aunt l onie it was quite enough that i should bear an exaggerated resemblance to my father to the extent of not being satisfied like him with consulting the barometer but becoming an animated barometer myself it was quite enough that i should allow myself to be ordered by my aunt l onie to stay at home and watch the weather from my bedroom window or even from my bed yet here i was talking now to albertine at one moment as the child that i had been at combray used to talk to my mother at another as my grandmother used to talk to me when we have passed a certain age the soul of the child that we were and the souls of the dead from whom we spring come and bestow upon us in handfuls their treasures and their calamities asking to be allowed to cooperate in the new sentiments which we are feeling and in which obliterating their former image we recast them in an original creation thus my whole past from my earliest years and earlier still the past of my parents and relatives blended with my impure love for albertine the charm of an affection at once filial and maternal we have to give hospitality at a certain stage in our life to all our relatives who have journeyed so far and gathered round us before albertine obeyed and allowed me to take off her shoes i opened her chemise her two little upstanding breasts were so round that they seemed not so much to be an integral part of her body as to have ripened there like fruit and her belly concealing the place where a man s is marred as though by an iron clamp left sticking in a statue that has been taken down from its niche was closed at the junction of her thighs by two valves of a curve as hushed as reposeful as cloistral as that of the horizon after the sun has set she took off her shoes and lay down by my side o mighty attitudes of man and woman in which there seeks to be reunited in the innocence of the world s first age and with the humility of clay what creation has cloven apart in which eve is astonished and submissive before the man by whose side she has awoken as he himself alone still before god who has fashioned him albertine folded her arms behind her dark hair her swelling hip her leg falling with the inflexion of a swan s neck that stretches upwards and then curves over towards its starting point it was only when she was lying right on her side that one saw a certain aspect of her face so good and handsome when one looked at it from in front which i could not endure hook nosed as in some of leonardo s caricatures seeming to indicate the shiftiness the greed for profit the cunning of a spy whose presence in my house would have filled me with horror and whom that profile seemed to unmask at once i took albertine s face in my hands and altered its position be a good boy promise me that if you don t come out to morrow you will work said my mistress as she slipped into her chemise yes but don t put on your dressing gown yet sometimes i ended by falling asleep by her side the room had grown cold more wood was wanted i tried to find the bell above my head but failed to do so after fingering all the copper rods in turn save those between which it hung and said to albertine who had sprung from the bed so that fran oise should not find us lying side by side no come back for a moment i can t find the bell comforting moments gay innocent to all appearance and yet moments in which there accumulates in us the never suspected possibility of disaster which makes the amorous life the most precarious of all that in which the incalculable rain of sulphur and brimstone falls after the most radiant moments after which without having the courage to derive its lesson from our mishap we set to work immediately to rebuild upon the slopes of the crater from which nothing but catastrophe can emerge i was as careless as everyone who imagines that his happiness will endure it is precisely because this comfort has been necessary to bring grief to birth and will return moreover at intervals to calm it that men can be sincere with each other and even with themselves when they pride themselves upon a woman s kindness to them although taking things all in all at the heart of their intimacy there lurks continually in a secret fashion unavowed to the rest of the world or revealed unintentionally by questions inquiries a painful uncertainty but as this could not have come to birth without the preliminary comfort as even afterwards the intermittent comfort is necessary to make suffering endurable and to prevent ruptures their concealment of the secret hell that life can be when shared with the woman in question carried to the pitch of an ostentatious display of an intimacy which they pretend is precious expresses a genuine point of view a universal process of cause and effect one of the modes in which the production of grief is rendered possible it no longer surprised me that albertine should be in the house and would not be going out to morrow save with myself or in the custody of andr e these habits of a life shared in common this broad outline which defined my existence and within which nobody might penetrate but albertine also in the future plan of which i was still unaware of my life to come like the plan traced by an architect for monumental structures which will not be erected until long afterwards the remoter lines parallel to the others but vaster that sketched in me like a lonely hermitage the somewhat rigid and monotonous formula of my future loves had in reality been traced that night at balbec when in the little tram after albertine had revealed to me who it was that had brought her up i had decided at any cost to remove her from certain influences and to prevent her from straying out of my sight for some days to come day after day had gone by these habits had become mechanical but like those primitive rites the meaning of which historians seek to discover i might but would not have said to anybody who asked me what i meant by this life of seclusion which i carried so far as not to go any more to the theatre that its origin was the anxiety of a certain evening and my need to prove to myself during the days that followed that the girl whose unfortunate childhood i had learned should not find it possible if she wished to expose herself to similar temptations i no longer thought save very rarely of these possibilities but they were nevertheless to remain vaguely present in my consciousness the fact that i was destroying or trying to destroy them day by day was doubtless the reason why it comforted me to kiss those cheeks which were no more beautiful than many others beneath any carnal attraction which is at all profound there is the permanent possibility of danger i had promised albertine that if i did not go out with her i would settle down to work but in the morning just as if taking advantage of our being asleep the house had miraculously flown i awoke in different weather beneath another clime we do not begin to work at the moment of landing in a strange country to the conditions of which we have to adapt ourself but each day was for me a different country even my laziness itself beneath the novel forms that it had assumed how was i to recognise it sometimes on days when the weather was according to everyone past praying for the mere act of staying in the house situated in the midst of a steady and continuous rain had all the gliding charm the soothing silence the interest of a sea voyage at another time on a bright day to lie still in bed was to let the lights and shadows play around me as round a tree trunk or yet again in the first strokes of the bell of a neighbouring convent rare as the early morning worshippers barely whitening the dark sky with their fluttering snowfall melted and scattered by the warm breeze i had discerned one of those tempestuous disordered delightful days when the roofs soaked by an occasional shower and dried by a breath of wind or a ray of sunshine let fall a cooing eavesdrop and as they wait for the wind to resume its turn preen in the momentary sunlight that has burnished them their pigeon s breast of slates one of those days filled with so many changes of weather atmospheric incidents storms that the idle man does not feel that he has wasted them because he has been taking an interest in the activity which in default of himself the atmosphere acting in a sense in his stead has displayed days similar to those times of revolution or war which do not seem empty to the schoolboy who has played truant from his classroom because by loitering outside the law courts or by reading the newspapers he has the illusion of finding in the events that have occurred failing the lesson which he has not learned an intellectual profit and an excuse for his idleness days to which we may compare those on which there occurs in our life some exceptional crisis from which the man who has never done anything imagines that he is going to acquire if it comes to a happy issue laborious habits for instance the morning on which he sets out for a duel which is to be fought under particularly dangerous conditions then he is suddenly made aware at the moment when it is perhaps about to be taken from him of the value of a life of which he might have made use to begin some important work or merely to enjoy pleasures and of which he has failed to make any use at all if i can only not be killed he says to himself how i shall settle down to work this very minute and how i shall enjoy myself too life has in fact suddenly acquired in his eyes a higher value because he puts into life everything that it seems to him capable of giving instead of the little that he normally makes it give he sees it in the light of his desire not as his experience has taught him that he was apt to make it that is to say so tawdry it has at that moment become filled with work travel mountain climbing all the pleasant things which he tells himself the fatal issue of the duel may render impossible whereas they were already impossible before there was any question of a duel owing to the bad habits which even had there been no duel would have persisted he returns home without even a scratch but he continues to find the same obstacles to pleasures excursions travel to everything of which he had feared for a moment to be for ever deprived by death to deprive him of them life has been sufficient as for work exceptional circumstances having the effect of intensifying what previously existed in the man labour in the laborious laziness in the lazy he takes a holiday i followed his example and did as i had always done since my first resolution to become a writer which i had made long ago but which seemed to me to date from yesterday because i had regarded each intervening day as non existent i treated this day in a similar fashion allowing its showers of rain and bursts of sunshine to pass without doing anything and vowing that i would begin to work on the morrow but then i was no longer the same man beneath a cloudless sky the golden note of the bells did not contain merely as honey contains light but the sensation of light and also the sickly savour of preserved fruits because at combray it had often loitered like a wasp over our cleared dinner table on this day of dazzling sunshine to remain until nightfall with my eyes shut was a thing permitted customary healthgiving pleasant seasonable like keeping the outside shutters closed against the heat it was in such weather as this that at the beginning of my second visit to balbec i used to hear the violins of the orchestra amid the bluish flow of the rising tide how much more fully did i possess albertine to day there were days when the sound of a bell striking the hour bore upon the sphere of its resonance a plate so cool so richly loaded with moisture or with light that it was like a transcription for the blind or if you prefer a musical interpretation of the charm of rain or of the charm of the sun so much so that at that moment as i lay in bed with my eyes shut i said to myself that everything is capable of transposition and that a universe which was merely audible might be as full of variety as the other travelling lazily upstream from day to day as in a boat and seeing appear before my eyes an endlessly changing succession of enchanted memories which i did not select which a moment earlier had been invisible and which my mind presented to me one after another without my being free to choose them i pursued idly over that continuous expanse my stroll in the sunshine you might also like those morning concerts at balbec were not remote in time and yet at that comparatively recent moment i had given but little thought to albertine indeed on the very first mornings after my arrival i had not known that she was at balbec from whom then had i learned it oh yes from aim it was a fine sunny day like this he was glad to see me again but he does not like albertine not everybody can be in love with her yes it was he who told me that she was at balbec but how did he know ah he had met her had thought that she had a bad style at that moment as i regarded aim s story from another aspect than that in which he had told me it my thoughts which hitherto had been sailing blissfully over these untroubled waters exploded suddenly as though they had struck an invisible and perilous mine treacherously moored at this point in my memory he had told me that he had met her that he had thought her style bad what had he meant by a bad style i had understood him to mean a vulgar manner because to contradict him in advance i had declared that she was most refined but no perhaps he had meant the style of gomorrah she was with another girl perhaps their arms were round one another s waist they were staring at other women they were indeed displaying a style which i had never seen albertine adopt in my presence who was the other girl where had aim met her this odious albertine i tried to recall exactly what aim had said to me in order to see whether it could be made to refer to what i imagined or he had meant nothing more than common manners but in vain might i ask the question the person who put it and the person who might supply the recollection were alas one and the same person myself who was momentarily duplicated but without adding anything to my stature question as i might it was myself who answered i learned nothing fresh i no longer gave a thought to mlle vinteuil born of a novel suspicion the fit of jealousy from which i was suffering was novel also or rather it was only the prolongation the extension of that suspicion it had the same theatre which was no longer montjouvain but the road upon which aim had met albertine and for its object the various friends one or other of whom might be she who had been with albertine that day it was perhaps a certain elisabeth or else perhaps those two girls whom albertine had watched in the mirror at the casino while appearing not to notice them she had doubtless been having relations with them and also with esther bloch s cousin such relations had they been revealed to me by a third person would have been enough almost to kill me but as it was myself that was imagining them i took care to add sufficient uncertainty to deaden the pain we succeed in absorbing daily under the guise of suspicions in enormous doses this same idea that we are being betrayed a quite minute quantity of which might prove fatal if injected by the needle of a stabbing word it is no doubt for that reason and by a survival of the instinct of self preservation that the same jealous man does not hesitate to form the most terrible suspicions upon a basis of innocuous details provided that whenever any proof is brought to him he may decline to accept its evidence anyhow love is an incurable malady like those diathetic states in which rheumatism affords the sufferer a brief respite only to be replaced by epileptiform headaches was my jealous suspicion calmed i then felt a grudge against albertine for not having been gentle with me perhaps for having made fun of me to andr e i thought with alarm of the idea that she must have formed if andr e had repeated all our conversations the future loomed black and menacing this mood of depression left me only if a fresh jealous suspicion drove me upon another quest or if on the other hand albertine s display of affection made the actual state of my fortunes seem to me immaterial whoever this girl might be i should have to write to aim to try to see him and then i should check his statement by talking to albertine hearing her confession in the meantime convinced that it must be bloch s cousin i asked bloch himself who had not the remotest idea of my purpose simply to let me see her photograph or better still to arrange if possible for me to meet her how many persons cities roads does not jealousy make us eager thus to know it is a thirst for knowledge thanks to which with regard to various isolated points we end by acquiring every possible notion in turn except those that we require we can never tell whether a suspicion will not arise for all of a sudden we recall a sentence that was not clear an alibi that cannot have been given us without a purpose and yet we have not seen the person again but there is such a thing as a posthumous jealousy that is born only after we have left her a jealousy of the doorstep perhaps the habit that i had formed of nursing in my bosom several simultaneous desires a desire for a young girl of good family such as i used to see pass beneath my window escorted by her governess and especially of the girl whom saint loup had mentioned to me the one who frequented houses of ill fame a desire for handsome lady s maids and especially for the maid of mme putbus a desire to go to the country in early spring to see once again hawthorns apple trees in blossom storms at sea a desire for venice a desire to settle down to work a desire to live like other people perhaps the habit of storing up without assuaging any of them all these desires contenting myself with the promise made to myself that i would not forget to satisfy them one day perhaps this habit so many years old already of perpetual postponement of what m de charlus used to castigate under the name of procrastination had become so prevalent in me that it assumed control of my jealous suspicions also and while it made me take a mental note that i would not fail some day to have an explanation from albertine with regard to the girl possibly the girls this part of the story was confused rubbed out that is to say obliterated in my memory with whom aim had met her made me also postpone this explanation in any case i would not mention it this evening to my mistress for fear of making her think me jealous and so offending her and yet when on the following day bloch had sent me the photograph of his cousin esther i made haste to forward it to aim and at the same moment i remembered that albertine had that morning refused me a pleasure which might indeed have tired her was that in order to reserve it for some one else this afternoon perhaps for whom thus it is that jealousy is endless for even if the beloved object by dying for instance can no longer provoke it by her actions it so happens that posthumous memories of later origin than any event take shape suddenly in our minds as though they were events also memories which hitherto we have never properly explored which had seemed to us unimportant and to which our own meditation upon them has been sufficient without any external action to give a new and terrible meaning we have no need of her company it is enough to be alone in our room thinking for fresh betrayals of us by our mistress to come to light even though she be dead and so we ought not to fear in love as in everyday life the future alone but even the past which often we do not succeed in realising until the future has come and gone and we are not speaking only of the past which we discover long afterwards but of the past which we have long kept stored up in ourselves and learn suddenly how to interpret no matter i was very glad now that afternoon was turning to evening that the hour was not far off when i should be able to appeal to albertine s company for the consolation of which i stood in need unfortunately the evening that followed was one of those on which this consolation was not afforded me on which the kiss that albertine would give me when she left me for the night very different from her ordinary kiss would no more soothe me than my mother s kiss had soothed me long ago on days when she was vexed with me and i dared not send for her but at the same time knew that i should not be able to sleep such evenings were now those on which albertine had formed for the morrow some plan of which she did not wish me to know had she confided in me i would have employed to assure its successful execution an ardour which none but albertine could have inspired in me but she told me nothing nor had she any need to tell me anything as soon as she came in before she had even crossed the threshold of my room as she was still wearing her hat or toque i had already detected the unknown restive desperate indomitable desire now these were often the evenings when i had awaited her return with the most loving thoughts and looked forward to throwing my arms round her neck with the warmest affection alas those misunderstandings that i had often had with my parents whom i found cold or cross at the moment when i was running to embrace them overflowing with love are nothing in comparison with these that occur between lovers the anguish then is far less superficial far harder to endure it has its abode in a deeper stratum of the heart this evening however albertine was obliged to mention the plan that she had in her mind i gathered at once that she wished to go next day to pay a call on mme verdurin a call to which in itself i would have had no objection but evidently her object was to meet some one there to prepare some future pleasure otherwise she would not have attached so much importance to this call that is to say she would not have kept on assuring me that it was of no importance i had in the course of my life developed in the opposite direction to those races which make use of phonetic writing only after regarding the letters of the alphabet as a set of symbols i who for so many years had sought for the real life and thought of other people only in the direct statements with which they furnished me of their own free will failing these had come to attach importance on the contrary only to the evidence that is not a rational and analytical expression of the truth the words themselves did not enlighten me unless they could be interpreted in the same way as a sudden rush of blood to the cheeks of a person who is embarrassed or what is even more telling a sudden silence some subsidiary word such as that used by m de cambremer when he understood that i was literary and not having spoken to me before as he was describing a visit that he had paid to the verdurins turned to me with why boreli was there bursting into flames at the unintended sometimes perilous contact of two ideas which the speaker has not expressed but which by applying the appropriate methods of analysis or electrolysis i was able to extract from it told me more than a long speech albertine sometimes allowed to appear in her conversation one or other of these precious amalgams which i made haste to treat so as to transform them into lucid ideas it is by the way one of the most terrible calamities for the lover that if particular details which only experiment espionage of all the possible realisations would ever make him know are so difficult to discover the truth on the other hand is easy to penetrate or merely to feel by instinct often i had seen her at balbec fasten upon some girls who came past us a sharp and lingering stare like a physical contact after which if i knew the girls she would say to me suppose we asked them to join us i should so love to be rude to them and now for some time past doubtless since she had succeeded in reading my character no request to me to invite anyone not a word never even a sidelong glance from her eyes which had become objectless and mute and as revealing with the vague and vacant expression of the rest of her face as had been their magnetic swerve before now it was impossible for me to reproach her or to ply her with questions about things which she would have declared to be so petty so trivial things that i had stored up in my mind simply for the pleasure of making mountains out of molehills it is hard enough to say why did you stare at that girl who went past but a great deal harder to say why did you not stare at her and yet i knew quite well or at least i should have known if i had not chosen to believe albertine s assertions rather than all the trivialities contained in a glance proved by it and by some contradiction or other in her speech a contradiction which often i did not perceive until long after i had left her which kept me on tenterhooks all the night long which i never dared mention to her again but which nevertheless continued to honour my memory from time to time with its periodical visits often in the case of these furtive or sidelong glances on the beach at balbec or in the streets of paris i might ask myself whether the person who provoked them was not merely at the moment when she passed an object of desire but was an old acquaintance or else some girl who had simply been mentioned to her and of whom when i heard about it i was astonished that anybody could have spoken to her so utterly unlike was she to anyone that albertine could possibly wish to know but the gomorrah of to day is a dissected puzzle made up of fragments which are picked up in the places where we least expected to find them thus i once saw at rivebelle a big dinner party of ten women all of whom i happened to know at least by name women as unlike one another as possible perfectly united nevertheless so much so that i never saw a party so homogeneous albeit so compo,"['flow', 'enlighten',

okakura i the cup of humanity tea began as a medicine and grew into a beverage in china in the eighth century it entered the realm of poetry as one of the polite amusements the fifteenth century saw japan ennoble it into a religion of aestheticism teaism teaism is a cult founded on the adoration of the beautiful among the sordid facts of everyday existence it inculcates purity and harmony the mystery of mutual charity the romanticism of the social order it is essentially a worship of the imperfect as it is a tender attempt to accomplish something possible in this impossible thing we know as life the philosophy of tea is not mere aestheticism in the ordinary acceptance of the term for it expresses conjointly with ethics and religion our whole point of view about man and nature it is hygiene for it enforces cleanliness it is economics for it shows comfort in simplicity rather than in the complex and costly it is moral geometry inasmuch as it defines our sense of proportion to the universe it represents the true spirit of eastern democracy by making all its votaries aristocrats in taste the long isolation of japan from the rest of the world so conducive to introspection has been highly favourable to the development of teaism our home and habits costume and cuisine porcelain lacquer painting our very literature all have been subject to its influence no student of japanese culture could ever ignore its presence it has permeated the elegance of noble boudoirs and entered the abode of the humble our peasants have learned to arrange flowers our meanest labourer to offer his salutation to the rocks and waters in our common parlance we speak of the man with no tea in him when he is insusceptible to the serio comic interests of the personal drama again we stigmatise the untamed aesthete who regardless of the mundane tragedy runs riot in the springtide of emancipated emotions as one with too much tea in him the outsider may indeed wonder at this seeming much ado about nothing what a tempest in a tea cup he will say but when we consider how small after all the cup of human enjoyment is how soon overflowed with tears how easily drained to the dregs in our quenchless thirst for infinity we shall not blame ourselves for making so much of the tea cup mankind has done worse in the worship of bacchus we have sacrificed too freely and we have even transfigured the gory image of mars why not consecrate ourselves to the queen of the camelias and revel in the warm stream of sympathy that flows from her altar in the liquid amber within the ivory porcelain the initiated may touch the sweet reticence of confucius the piquancy of laotse and the ethereal aroma of sakyamuni himself those who cannot feel the littleness of great things in themselves are apt to overlook the greatness of little things in others the average westerner in his sleek complacency will see in the tea ceremony but another instance of the thousand and one oddities which constitute the quaintness and childishness of the east to him he was wont to regard japan as barbarous while she indulged in the gentle arts of peace he calls her civilised since she began to commit wholesale slaughter on manchurian battlefields much comment has been given lately to the code of the samurai the art of death which makes our soldiers exult in self sacrifice but scarcely any attention has been drawn to teaism which represents so much of our art of life fain would we remain barbarians if our claim to civilisation were to be based on the gruesome glory of war fain would we await the time when due respect shall be paid to our art and ideals when will the west understand or try to understand the east we asiatics are often appalled by the curious web of facts and fancies which has been woven concerning us we are pictured as living on the perfume of the lotus if not on mice and cockroaches it is either impotent fanaticism or else abject voluptuousness indian spirituality has been derided as ignorance chinese sobriety as stupidity japanese patriotism as the result of fatalism it has been said that we are less sensible to pain and wounds on account of the callousness of our nervous organisation why not amuse yourselves at our expense asia returns the compliment there would be further food for merriment if you were to know all that we have imagined and written about you all the glamour of the perspective is there all the unconscious homage of wonder all the silent resentment of the new and undefined you have been loaded with virtues too refined to be envied and accused of crimes too picturesque to be condemned our writers in the past the wise men who knew informed us that you had bushy tails somewhere hidden in your garments and often dined off a fricassee of newborn babes nay we had something worse against you we used to think you the most impracticable people on the earth for you were said to preach what you never practiced such misconceptions are fast vanishing amongst us commerce has forced the european tongues on many an eastern port asiatic youths are flocking to western colleges for the equipment of modern education our insight does not penetrate your culture deeply but at least we are willing to learn some of my compatriots have adopted too much of your customs and too much of your etiquette in the delusion that the acquisition of stiff collars and tall silk hats comprised the attainment of your civilisation pathetic and deplorable as such affectations are they evince our willingness to approach the west on our knees unfortunately the western attitude is unfavourable to the understanding of the east the christian missionary goes to impart but not to receive your information is based on the meagre translations of our immense literature if not on the unreliable anecdotes of passing travellers it is rarely that the chivalrous pen of a lafcadio hearn or that of the author of the web of indian life enlivens the oriental darkness with the torch of our own sentiments perhaps i betray my own ignorance of the tea cult by being so outspoken its very spirit of politeness exacts that you say what you are expected to say and no more but i am not to be a polite teaist so much harm has been done already by the mutual misunderstanding of the new world and the old that one need not apologise for contributing his tithe to the furtherance of a better understanding the beginning of the twentieth century would have been spared the spectacle of sanguinary warfare if russia had condescended to know japan better what dire consequences to humanity lie in the contemptuous ignoring of eastern problems european imperialism which does not disdain to raise the absurd cry of the yellow peril fails to realise that asia may also awaken to the cruel sense of the white disaster you may laugh at us for having too much tea but may we not suspect that you of the west have no tea in your constitution let us stop the continents from hurling epigrams at each other and be sadder if not wiser by the mutual gain of half a hemisphere we have developed along different lines but there is no reason why one should not supplement the other you have gained expansion at the cost of restlessness we have created a harmony which is weak against aggression will you believe it the east is better off in some respects than the west strangely enough humanity has so far met in the tea cup it is the only asiatic ceremonial which commands universal esteem the white man has scoffed at our religion and our morals but has accepted the brown beverage without hesitation the afternoon tea is now an important function in western society in the delicate clatter of trays and saucers in the soft rustle of feminine hospitality in the common catechism about cream and sugar we know that the worship of tea is established beyond question the philosophic resignation of the guest to the fate awaiting him in the dubious decoction proclaims that in this single instance the oriental spirit reigns supreme the earliest record of tea in european writing is said to be found in the statement of an arabian traveller that after the year the main sources of revenue in canton were the duties on salt and tea marco polo records the deposition of a chinese minister of finance in for his arbitrary augmentation of the tea taxes it was at the period of the great discoveries that the european people began to know more about the extreme orient at the end of the sixteenth century the hollanders brought the news that a pleasant drink was made in the east from the leaves of a bush the travellers giovanni batista ramusio l almeida maffeno tareira also mentioned tea in the last named year ships of the dutch east india company brought the first tea into europe it was known in france in and reached russia in england welcomed it in and spoke of it as that excellent and by all physicians approved china drink called by the chineans tcha and by other nations tay alias tee like all good things of the world the propaganda of tea met with opposition heretics like henry saville denounced drinking it as a filthy custom jonas hanway essay on tea said that men seemed to lose their stature and comeliness women their beauty through the use of tea its cost at the start about fifteen or sixteen shillings a pound forbade popular consumption and made it regalia for high treatments and entertainments presents being made thereof to princes and grandees yet in spite of such drawbacks tea drinking spread with marvellous rapidity the coffee houses of london in the early half of the eighteenth century became in fact tea houses the resort of wits like addison and steele who beguiled themselves over their dish of tea the beverage soon became a necessity of life a taxable matter we are reminded in this connection what an important part it plays in modern history colonial america resigned herself to oppression until human endurance gave way before the heavy duties laid on tea american independence dates from the throwing of tea chests into boston harbour there is a subtle charm in the taste of tea which makes it irresistible and capable of idealisation western humourists were not slow to mingle the fragrance of their thought with its aroma it has not the arrogance of wine the self consciousness of coffee nor the simpering innocence of cocoa already in says the spectator i would therefore in a particular manner recommend these my speculations to all well regulated families that set apart an hour every morning for tea bread and butter and would earnestly advise them for their good to order this paper to be punctually served up and to be looked upon as a part of the tea equipage samuel johnson draws his own portrait as a hardened and shameless tea drinker who for twenty years diluted his meals with only the infusion of the fascinating plant who with tea amused the evening with tea solaced the midnight and with tea welcomed the morning charles lamb a professed devotee sounded the true note of teaism when he wrote that the greatest pleasure he knew was to do a good action by stealth and to have it found out by accident for teaism is the art of concealing beauty that you may discover it of suggesting what you dare not reveal it is the noble secret of laughing at yourself calmly yet thoroughly and is thus humour itself the smile of philosophy all genuine humourists may in this sense be called tea philosophers thackeray for instance and of course shakespeare the poets of the decadence when was not the world in decadence in their protests against materialism have to a certain extent also opened the way to teaism perhaps nowadays it is our demure contemplation of the imperfect that the west and the east can meet in mutual consolation the taoists relate that at the great beginning of the no beginning spirit and matter met in mortal combat at last the yellow emperor the sun of heaven triumphed over shuhyung the demon of darkness and earth the titan in his death agony struck his head against the solar vault and shivered the blue dome of jade into fragments the stars lost their nests the moon wandered aimlessly among the wild chasms of the night in despair the yellow emperor sought far and wide for the repairer of the heavens he had not to search in vain out of the eastern sea rose a queen the divine niuka horn crowned and dragon tailed resplendent in her armor of fire she welded the five coloured rainbow in her magic cauldron and rebuilt the chinese sky but it is told that niuka forgot to fill two tiny crevices in the blue firmament thus began the dualism of love two souls rolling through space and never at rest until they join together to complete the universe everyone has to build anew his sky of hope and peace the heaven of modern humanity is indeed shattered in the cyclopean struggle for wealth and power the world is groping in the shadow of egotism and vulgarity knowledge is bought through a bad conscience benevolence practiced for the sake of utility the east and the west like two dragons tossed in a sea of ferment in vain strive to regain the jewel of life we need a niuka again to repair the grand devastation we await the great avatar meanwhile let us have a sip of tea the afternoon glow is brightening the bamboos the fountains are bubbling with delight the soughing of the pines is heard in our kettle let us dream of evanescence and linger in the beautiful foolishness of things ii the schools of tea tea is a work of art and needs a master hand to bring out its noblest qualities we have good and bad tea as we have good and bad paintings generally the latter there is no single recipe for making the perfect tea as there are no rules for producing a titian or a sesson each preparation of the leaves has its individuality its special affinity with water and heat its own method of telling a story the truly beautiful must always be in it how much do we not suffer through the constant failure of society to recognise this simple and fundamental law of art and life lichilai a sung poet has sadly remarked that there were three most deplorable things in the world the spoiling of fine youths through false education the degradation of fine art through vulgar admiration and the utter waste of fine tea through incompetent manipulation like art tea has its periods and its schools its evolution may be roughly divided into three main stages the boiled tea the whipped tea and the steeped tea we moderns belong to the last school these several methods of appreciating the beverage are indicative of the spirit of the age in which they prevailed for life is an expression our unconscious actions the constant betrayal of our innermost thought confucius said that man hideth not perhaps we reveal ourselves too much in small things because we have so little of the great to conceal the tiny incidents of daily routine are as much a commentary of racial ideals as the highest flight of philosophy or poetry even as the difference in favorite vintage marks the separate idiosyncrasies of different periods and nationalities of europe so the tea ideals characterise the various moods of oriental culture the cake tea which was boiled the powdered tea which was whipped the leaf tea which was steeped mark the distinct emotional impulses of the tang the sung and the ming dynasties of china if we were inclined to borrow the much abused terminology of art classification we might designate them respectively the classic the romantic and the naturalistic schools of tea the tea plant a native of southern china was known from very early times to chinese botany and medicine it is alluded to in the classics under the various names of tou tseh chung kha and ming and was highly prized for possessing the virtues of relieving fatigue delighting the soul strengthening the will and repairing the eyesight it was not only administered as an internal dose but often applied externally in form of paste to alleviate rheumatic pains the taoists claimed it as an important ingredient of the elixir of immortality the buddhists used it extensively to prevent drowsiness during their long hours of meditation by the fourth and fifth centuries tea became a favourite beverage among the inhabitants of the yangtse kiang valley it was about this time that modern ideograph cha was coined evidently a corruption of the classic tou the poets of the southern dynasties have left some fragments of their fervent adoration of the froth of the liquid jade then emperors used to bestow some rare preparation of the leaves on their high ministers as a reward for eminent services yet the method of drinking tea at this stage was primitive in the extreme the leaves were steamed crushed in a mortar made into a cake and boiled together with rice ginger salt orange peel spices milk and sometimes with onions the custom obtains at the present day among the thibetans and various mongolian tribes who make a curious syrup of these ingredients the use of lemon slices by the russians who learned to take tea from the chinese caravansaries points to the survival of the ancient method it needed the genius of the tang dynasty to emancipate tea from its crude state and lead to its final idealization with luwuh in the middle of the eighth century we have our first apostle of tea he was born in an age when buddhism taoism and confucianism were seeking mutual synthesis the pantheistic symbolism of the time was urging one to mirror the universal in the particular luwuh a poet saw in the tea service the same harmony and order which reigned through all things in his celebrated work the chaking the holy scripture of tea he formulated the code of tea he has since been worshipped as the tutelary god of the chinese tea merchants the chaking consists of three volumes and ten chapters in the first chapter luwuh treats of the nature of the tea plant in the second of the implements for gathering the leaves in the third of the selection of the leaves according to him the best quality of the leaves must have creases like the leathern boot of tartar horsemen curl like the dewlap of a mighty bullock unfold like a mist rising out of a ravine gleam like a lake touched by a zephyr and be wet and soft like fine earth newly swept by rain the fourth chapter is devoted to the enumeration and description of the twenty four members of the tea equipage beginning with the tripod brazier and ending with the bamboo cabinet for containing all these utensils here we notice luwuh s predilection for taoist symbolism also it is interesting to observe in this connection the influence of tea on chinese ceramics the celestial porcelain as is well known had its origin in an attempt to reproduce the exquisite shade of jade resulting in the tang dynasty in the blue glaze of the south and the white glaze of the north luwuh considered the blue as the ideal colour for the tea cup as it lent additional greenness to the beverage whereas the white made it look pinkish and distasteful it was because he used cake tea later on when the tea masters of sung took to the powdered tea they preferred heavy bowls of blue black and dark brown the mings with their steeped tea rejoiced in light ware of white porcelain in the fifth chapter luwuh describes the method of making tea he eliminates all ingredients except salt he dwells also on the much discussed question of the choice of water and the degree of boiling it according to him the mountain spring is the best the river water and the spring water come next in the order of excellence there are three stages of boiling the first boil is when the little bubbles like the eye of fishes swim on the surface the second boil is when the bubbles are like crystal beads rolling in a fountain the third boil is when the billows surge wildly in the kettle the cake tea is roasted before the fire until it becomes soft like a baby s arm and is shredded into powder between pieces of fine paper salt is put in the first boil the tea in the second at the third boil a dipperful of cold water is poured into the kettle to settle the tea and revive the youth of the water then the beverage was poured into cups and drunk o nectar the filmy leaflet hung like scaly clouds in a serene sky or floated like waterlilies on emerald streams it was of such a beverage that lotung a tang poet wrote the first cup moistens my lips and throat the second cup breaks my loneliness the third cup searches my barren entrail but to find therein some five thousand volumes of odd ideographs the fourth cup raises a slight perspiration all the wrong of life passes away through my pores at the fifth cup i am purified the sixth cup calls me to the realms of the immortals the seventh cup ah but i could take no more i only feel the breath of cool wind that rises in my sleeves where is horaisan let me ride on this sweet breeze and waft away thither the remaining chapters of the chaking treat of the vulgarity of the ordinary methods of tea drinking a historical summary of illustrious tea drinkers the famous tea plantations of china the possible variations of the tea service and illustrations of the tea utensils the last is unfortunately lost the appearance of the chaking must have created considerable sensation at the time luwuh was befriended by the emperor taisung and his fame attracted many followers some exquisites were said to have been able to detect the tea made by luwuh from that of his disciples one mandarin has his name immortalised by his failure to appreciate the tea of this great master in the sung dynasty the whipped tea came into fashion and created the second school of tea the leaves were ground to fine powder in a small stone mill and the preparation was whipped in hot water by a delicate whisk made of split bamboo the new process led to some change in the tea equippage of luwuh as well as in the choice of leaves salt was discarded forever the enthusiasm of the sung people for tea knew no bounds epicures vied with each other in discovering new varieties and regular tournaments were held to decide their superiority the emperor kiasung who was too great an artist to be a well behaved monarch lavished his treasures on the attainment of rare species he himself wrote a dissertation on the twenty kinds of tea among which he prizes the white tea as of the rarest and finest quality the tea ideal of the sungs differed from the tangs even as their notion of life differed they sought to actualize what their predecessors tried to symbolise to the neo confucian mind the cosmic law was not reflected in the phenomenal world but the phenomenal world was the cosmic law itself aeons were but moments nirvana always within grasp the taoist conception that immortality lay in the eternal change permeated all their modes of thought it was the process not the deed which was interesting it was the completing not the completion which was really vital man came thus at once face to face with nature a new meaning grew into the art of life the tea began to be not a poetical pastime but one of the methods of self realisation wangyucheng eulogised tea as flooding his soul like a direct appeal that its delicate bitterness reminded him of the aftertaste of a good counsel sotumpa wrote of the strength of the immaculate purity in tea which defied corruption as a truly virtuous man among the buddhists the southern zen sect which incorporated so much of taoist doctrines formulated an elaborate ritual of tea the monks gathered before the image of bodhi dharma and drank tea out of a single bowl with the profound formality of a holy sacrament it was this zen ritual which finally developed into the tea ceremony of japan in the fifteenth century unfortunately the sudden outburst of the mongol tribes in the thirteenth century which resulted in the devastation and conquest of china under the barbaric rule of the yuen emperors destroyed all the fruits of sung culture the native dynasty of the mings which attempted re nationalisation in the middle of the fifteenth century was harassed by internal troubles and china again fell under the alien rule of the manchus in the seventeenth century manners and customs changed to leave no vestige of the former times the powdered tea is entirely forgotten we find a ming commentator at loss to recall the shape of the tea whisk mentioned in one of the sung classics tea is now taken by steeping the leaves in hot water in a bowl or cup the reason why the western world is innocent of the older method of drinking tea is explained by the fact that europe knew it only at the close of the ming dynasty to the latter day chinese tea is a delicious beverage but not an ideal the long woes of his country have robbed him of the zest for the meaning of life he has become modern that is to say old and disenchanted he has lost that sublime faith in illusions which constitutes the eternal youth and vigour of the poets and ancients he is an eclectic and politely accepts the traditions of the universe he toys with nature but does not condescend to conquer or worship her his leaf tea is often wonderful with its flower like aroma but the romance of the tang and sung ceremonials are not to be found in his cup japan which followed closely on the footsteps of chinese civilisation has known the tea in all its three stages as early as the year we read of the emperor shomu giving tea to one hundred monks at his palace in nara the leaves were probably imported by our ambassadors to the tang court and prepared in the way then in fashion in the monk saicho brought back some seeds and planted them in yeisan many tea gardens are heard of in succeeding centuries as well as the delight of the aristocracy and priesthood in the beverage the sung tea reached us in with the return of yeisai zenji who went there to study the southern zen school the new seeds which he carried home were successfully planted in three places one of which the uji district near kioto bears still the name of producing the best tea in the world the southern zen spread with marvellous rapidity and with it the tea ritual and the tea ideal of the sung by the fifteenth century under the patronage of the shogun ashikaga voshinasa the tea ceremony is fully constituted and made into an independent and secular performance since then teaism is fully established in japan the use of the steeped tea of the later china is comparatively recent among us being only known since the middle of the seventeenth century it has replaced the powdered tea in ordinary consumption though the latter still continues to hold its place as the tea of teas it is in the japanese tea ceremony that we see the culmination of tea ideals our successful resistance of the mongol invasion in had enabled us to carry on the sung movement so disastrously cut off in china itself through the nomadic inroad tea with us became more than an idealisation of the form of drinking it is a religion of the art of life the beverage grew to be an excuse for the worship of purity and refinement a sacred function at which the host and guest joined to produce for that occasion the utmost beatitude of the mundane the tea room was an oasis in the dreary waste of existence where weary travellers could meet to drink from the common spring of art appreciation the ceremony was an improvised drama whose plot was woven about the tea the flowers and the paintings not a colour to disturb the tone of the room not a sound to mar the rhythm of things not a gesture to obtrude on the harmony not a word to break the unity of the surroundings all movements to be performed simply and naturally such were the aims of the tea ceremony and strangely enough it was often successful a subtle philosophy lay behind it all teaism was taoism in disguise iii taoism and zennism the connection of zennism with tea is proverbial we have already remarked that the tea ceremony was a development of the zen ritual the name of laotse the founder of taoism is also intimately associated with the history of tea it is written in the chinese school manual concerning the origin of habits and customs that the ceremony of offering tea to a guest began with kwanyin a well known disciple of laotse who first at the gate of the han pass presented to the old philosopher a cup of the golden elixir we shall not stop to discuss the authenticity of such tales which are valuable however as confirming the early use of the beverage by the taoists our interest in taoism and zennism here lies mainly in those ideas regarding life and art which are so embodied in what we call teaism it is to be regretted that as yet there appears to be no adequate presentation of the taoists and zen doctrines in any foreign language though we have had several laudable attempts translation is always a treason and as a ming author observes can at its best be only the reverse side of a brocade all the threads are there but not the subtlety of colour or design but after all what great doctrine is there which is easy to expound the ancient sages never put their teachings in systematic form they spoke in paradoxes for they were afraid of uttering half truths they began by talking like fools and ended by making their hearers wise laotse himself with his quaint humour says if people of inferior intelligence hear of the tao they laugh immensely it would not be the tao unless they laughed at it the tao literally means a path it has been severally translated as the way the absolute the law nature supreme reason the mode these renderings are not incorrect for the use of the term by the taoists differs according to the subject matter of the inquiry laotse himself spoke of it thus there is a thing which is all containing which was born before the existence of heaven and earth how silent how solitary it stands alone and changes not it revolves without danger to itself and is the mother of the universe i do not know its name and so call it the path with reluctance i call it the infinite infinity is the fleeting the fleeting is the vanishing the vanishing is the reverting the tao is in the passage rather than the path it is the spirit of cosmic change the eternal growth which returns upon itself to produce new forms it recoils upon itself like the dragon the beloved symbol of the taoists it folds and unfolds as do the clouds the tao might be spoken of as the great transition subjectively it is the mood of the universe its absolute is the relative it should be remembered in the first place that taoism like its legitimate successor zennism represents the individualistic trend of the southern chinese mind in contra distinction to the communism of northern china which expressed itself in confucianism the middle kingdom is as vast as europe and has a differentiation of idiosyncrasies marked by the two great river systems which traverse it the yangste kiang and hoang ho are respectively the mediterranean and the baltic even to day in spite of centuries of unification the southern celestial differs in his thoughts and beliefs from his northern brother as a member of the latin race differs from the teuton in ancient days when communication was even more difficult than at present and especially during the feudal period this difference in thought was most pronounced the art and poetry of the one breathes an atmosphere entirely distinct from that of the other in laotse and his followers and in kutsugen the forerunner of the yangtse kiang nature poets we find an idealism quite inconsistent with the prosaic ethical notions of their contemporary northern writers laotse lived five centuries before the christian era the germ of taoist speculation may be found long before the advent of laotse surnamed the long eared the archaic records of china especially the book of changes foreshadow his thought but the great respect paid to the laws and customs of that classic period of chinese civilisation which culminated with the establishment of the chow dynasty in the sixteenth century b c kept the development of individualism in check for a long while so that it was not until after the disintegration of the chow dynasty and the establishment of innumerable independent kingdoms that it was able to blossom forth in the luxuriance of free thought laotse and soshi chuangtse were both southerners and the greatest exponents of the new school on the other hand confucius with his numerous disciples aimed at retaining ancestral conventions taoism cannot be understood without some knowledge of confucianism and vice versa we have said that the taoist absolute was the relative in ethics the taoist railed at the laws and the moral codes of society for to them right and wrong were but relative terms definition is,"['secret',

administration opened the harbor at mariel cuba with the apparent intention of letting some of his people join their relatives in the united states within seventy two hours u s boats were headed for

closed marielitos had landed in florida an estimated had criminal records this is the story of that minority those they call los bandidos the prologue is shredded diagonally by the blade of a stiletto and in the empty black void we cut to opening montage documentary footage the disembarkation from the harbor in mariel cuba vessels of every nature waving masses demonstrations the crossing sun and

pitts pitts no sir a science experiment radar keating gentlemen open your texts to page of this introduction mr perry will you read the opening paragraph of the preface entitled understanding poetry neil understanding poetry by dr j evans pritchard ph d to fully understand poetry we must first be fluent with its meter rhyme and figures of speech then ask two questions how artfully has the objective of the poem been rendered and how important is that objective question rates the poem s perfection question rates its importance and once these questions have been answered determining the poem s greatness becomes a relatively simple matter neil if the poem s score for perfection is plotted on the horizontal of a graph and its importance is plotted on the vertical then calculating the total area of the poem yields the measure of its greatness neil a sonnet by byron might score high on the vertical but only average on the horizontal a shakespearean sonnet on the other hand would score high both horizontally and vertically yielding a massive total area thereby revealing the poem to be truly great as you proceed through the poetry in this book practice this rating method as your ability to evaluate poems in this matter grows so will so will your enjoyment and understanding of poetry keating excrement that s what i think of mr j evans pritchard we re not laying pipe we re talking about poetry how can you describe poetry like american bandstand oh i like byron i give him a but i can t dance to it now i want you to rip out that page keating go on rip out the entire page you heard me rip it out rip it out go on rip it out keating thank you mr dalton gentlemen tell you what don t just tear out that page tear out the entire introduction i want it gone history leave nothing of it rip it out rip be gone j evans pritchard ph d rip shred tear rip it out i want to hear nothing but ripping of mr pritchard we ll perforate it put it on a roll it s not the bible you re not gonna go to hell for this keating go on make a clean tear i want nothing left of it cameron we shouldn t be doing this keating rip rip rip rip it out rip keating rip it out mcallister what the hell is going on here keating i don t hear enough rips mcallister mr keating keating mr mcallister mcallister i m sorry i i didn t know you were here keating i am ah mcallister so you are excuse me keating keep ripping gentlemen this is a battle a war and the casualties could be your hearts and souls thank you dalton armies of academics going forward measuring poetry no we ll not have that here no more mr j evans pritchard now my class you will learn to think for yourselves again you will learn to savor words and language no matter what anybody tells you words and ideas can change the world now i see that look in mr pitts eye like th century literature has nothing to do with going to business school or medical school right maybe mr hopkins you may agree with him thinking yes we should simply study our mr pritchard and learn our rhyme and meter and go quietly about the business of achieving other ambitions i ve a little secret for you huddle up huddle up keating we don t read and write poetry because it s cute we read and write poetry because we are members of the human race and the human race is filled with passion and medicine law business engineering these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life but poetry beauty romance love these are what we stay alive for to quote from whitman o me o life of the question of these recurring of the endless trains of the faithless of cities fill d with the foolish what good amid these o me o life answer that you are here that life exists and identity that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse keating that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse what will your verse be boys for what we are about to receive may the lord make us truly grateful amen mcallister quite an interesting class you gave today mr keating keating sorry if i shocked you mr mcallister mcallister oh there s no need to apologize it was very fascinated misguided though it was keating you think so

george we re talking free thinkers mcallister free thinkers at seventeen keating funny i never pegged you as a cynic mcallister not a cynic a realist show me the heart unfettered by foolish dreams and

lyricsi the gospel of relaxation i wish in the following hour to take certain psychological doctrines and show their practical applications to mental hygiene to the hygiene of our american life more particularly our people especially in academic circles are turning towards psychology nowadays with great expectations and if psychology is to justify them it must be by showing fruits in the pedagogic and therapeutic lines the reader may possibly have heard of a peculiar theory of the emotions commonly referred to in psychological literature as the lange james theory according to this theory our emotions are mainly due to those organic stirrings that are aroused in us in a reflex way by the stimulus of the exciting object or situation an emotion of fear for example or surprise is not a direct effect of the object s presence on the mind but an effect of that still earlier effect the bodily commotion which the object suddenly excites so that were this bodily commotion suppressed we should not so much feel fear as call the situation fearful we should not feel surprise but coldly recognize that the object was indeed astonishing one enthusiast has even gone so far as to say that when we feel sorry it is because we weep when we feel afraid it is because we run away and not conversely some of you may perhaps be acquainted with the paradoxical formula now whatever exaggeration may possibly lurk in this account of our emotions and i doubt myself whether the exaggeration be very great it is certain that the main core of it is true and that the mere giving way to tears for example or to the outward expression of an anger fit will result for the moment in making the inner grief or anger more acutely felt there is accordingly no better known or more generally useful precept in the moral training of youth or in one s personal self discipline than that which bids us pay primary attention to what we do and express and not to care too much for what we feel if we only check a cowardly impulse in time for example or if we only don t strike the blow or rip out with the complaining or insulting word that we shall regret as long as we live our feelings themselves will presently be the calmer and better with no particular guidance from us on their own account action seems to follow feeling but really action and feeling go together and by regulating the action which is under the more direct control of the will we can indirectly regulate the feeling which is not thus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness if our spontaneous cheerfulness be lost is to sit up cheerfully to look round cheerfully and to act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there if such conduct does not make you soon feel cheerful nothing else on that occasion can so to feel brave act as if we were brave use all our will to that end and a courage fit will very likely replace the fit of fear again in order to feel kindly toward a person to whom we have been inimical the only way is more or less deliberately to smile to make sympathetic inquiries and to force ourselves to say genial things one hearty laugh together will bring enemies into a closer communion of heart than hours spent on both sides in inward wrestling with the mental demon of uncharitable feeling to wrestle with a bad feeling only pins our attention on it and keeps it still fastened in the mind whereas if we act as if from some better feeling the old bad feeling soon folds its tent like an arab and silently steals away the best manuals of religious devotion accordingly reiterate the maxim that we must let our feelings go and pay no regard to them whatever in an admirable and widely successful little book called the christian s secret of a happy life by mrs hannah whitall smith i find this lesson on almost every page act faithfully and you really have faith no matter how cold and even how dubious you may feel it is your purpose god looks at writes mrs smith not your feelings about that purpose and your purpose or will is therefore the only thing you need attend to let your emotions come or let them go just as god pleases and make no account of them either way they really have nothing to do with the matter they are not the indicators of your spiritual state but are merely the indicators of your temperament or of your present physical condition but you all know these facts already so i need no longer press them on your attention from our acts and from our attitudes ceaseless inpouring currents of sensation come which help to determine from moment to moment what our inner states shall be that is a fundamental law of psychology which i will therefore proceed to assume a viennese neurologist of considerable reputation has recently written about the binnenleben as he terms it or buried life of human beings no doctor this writer says can get into really profitable relations with a nervous patient until he gets some sense of what the patient s binnenleben is of the sort of unuttered inner atmosphere in which his consciousness dwells alone with the secrets of its prison house this inner personal tone is what we can t communicate or describe articulately to others but the wraith and ghost of it so to speak are often what our friends and intimates feel as our most characteristic quality in the unhealthy minded apart from all sorts of old regrets ambitions checked by shames and aspirations obstructed by timidities it consists mainly of bodily discomforts not distinctly localized by the sufferer but breeding a general self mistrust and sense that things are not as they should be with him half the thirst for alcohol that exists in the world exists simply because alcohol acts as a temporary an sthetic and effacer to all these morbid feelings that never ought to be in a human being at all in the healthy minded on the contrary there are no fears or shames to discover and the sensations that pour in from the organism only help to swell the general vital sense of security and readiness for anything that may turn up consider for example the effects of a well toned motor apparatus nervous and muscular on our general personal self consciousness the sense of elasticity and efficiency that results they tell us that in norway the life of the women has lately been entirely revolutionized by the new order of muscular feelings with which the use of the ski or long snow shoes as a sport for both sexes has made the women acquainted fifteen years ago the norwegian women were even more than the women of other lands votaries of the old fashioned ideal of femininity the domestic angel the gentle and refining influence sort of thing now these sedentary fireside tabby cats of norway have been trained they say by the snow shoes into lithe and audacious creatures for whom no night is too dark or height too giddy and who are not only saying good bye to the traditional feminine pallor and delicacy of constitution but actually taking the lead in every educational and social reform i cannot but think that the tennis and tramping and skating habits and the bicycle craze which are so rapidly extending among our dear sisters and daughters in this country are going also to lead to a sounder and heartier moral tone which will send its tonic breath through all our american life i hope that here in america more and more the ideal of the well trained and vigorous body will be maintained neck by neck with that of the well trained and vigorous mind as the two coequal halves of the higher education for men and women alike the strength of the british empire lies in the strength of character of the individual englishman taken all alone by himself and that strength i am persuaded is perennially nourished and kept up by nothing so much as by the national worship in which all classes meet of athletic outdoor life and sport i recollect years ago reading a certain work by an american doctor on hygiene and the laws of life and the type of future humanity i have forgotten its author s name and its title but i remember well an awful prophecy that it contained about the future of our muscular system human perfection the writer said means ability to cope with the environment but the environment will more and more require mental power from us and less and less will ask for bare brute strength wars will cease machines will do all our heavy work man will become more and more a mere director of nature s energies and less and less an exerter of energy on his own account so that if the homo sapiens of the future can only digest his food and think what need will he have of well developed muscles at all and why pursued this writer should we not even now be satisfied with a more delicate and intellectual type of beauty than that which pleased our ancestors nay i have heard a fanciful friend make a still further advance in this new man direction with our future food he says itself prepared in liquid form from the chemical elements of the atmosphere pepsinated or half digested in advance and sucked up through a glass tube from a tin can what need shall we have of teeth or stomachs even they may go along with our muscles and our physical courage while challenging ever more and more our proper admiration will grow the gigantic domes of our crania arching over our spectacled eyes and animating our flexible little lips to those floods of learned and ingenious talk which will constitute our most congenial occupation i am sure that your flesh creeps at this apocalyptic vision mine certainly did so and i cannot believe that our muscular vigor will ever be a superfluity even if the day ever dawns in which it will not be needed for fighting the old heavy battles against nature it will still always be needed to furnish the background of sanity serenity and cheerfulness to life to give moral elasticity to our disposition to round off the wiry edge of our fretfulness and make us good humored and easy of approach weakness is too apt to be what the doctors call irritable weakness and that blessed internal peace and confidence that acquiescentia in seipso as spinoza used to call it that wells up from every part of the body of a muscularly well trained human being and soaks the indwelling soul of him with satisfaction is quite apart from every consideration of its mechanical utility an element of spiritual hygiene of supreme significance and now let me go a step deeper into mental hygiene and try to enlist your insight and sympathy in a cause which i believe is one of paramount patriotic importance to us yankees many years ago a scottish medical man dr clouston a mad doctor as they call him there or what we should call an asylum physician the most eminent one in scotland visited this country and said something that has remained in my memory ever since you americans he said wear too much expression on your faces you are living like an army with all its reserves engaged in action the duller countenances of the british population betoken a better scheme of life they suggest stores of reserved nervous force to fall back upon if any occasion should arise that requires it this inexcitability this presence at all times of power not used i regard continued dr clouston as the great safeguard of our british people the other thing in you gives me a sense of insecurity and you ought somehow to tone yourselves down you really do carry too much expression you take too intensely the trivial moments of life now dr clouston is a trained reader of the secrets of the soul as expressed upon the countenance and the observation of his which i quote seems to me to mean a great deal and all americans who stay in europe long enough to get accustomed to the spirit that reigns and expresses itself there so unexcitable as compared with ours make a similar observation when they return to their native shores they find a wild eyed look upon their compatriots faces either of too desperate eagerness and anxiety or of too intense responsiveness and good will it is hard to say whether the men or the women show it most it is true that we do not all feel about it as dr clouston felt many of us far from deploring it admire it we say what intelligence it shows how different from the stolid cheeks the codfish eyes the slow inanimate demeanor we have been seeing in the british isles intensity rapidity vivacity of appearance are indeed with us something of a nationally accepted ideal and the medical notion of irritable weakness is not the first thing suggested by them to our mind as it was to dr clouston s in a weekly paper not very long ago i remember reading a story in which after describing the beauty and interest of the heroine s personality the author summed up her charms by saying that to all who looked upon her an impression as of bottled lightning was irresistibly conveyed bottled lightning in truth is one of our american ideals even of a young girl s character now it is most ungracious and it may seem to some persons unpatriotic to criticise in public the physical peculiarities of one s own people of one s own family so to speak besides it may be said and said with justice that there are plenty of bottled lightning temperaments in other countries and plenty of phlegmatic temperaments here and that when all is said and done the more or less of tension about which i am making such a fuss is a very small item in the sum total of a nation s life and not worth solemn treatment at a time when agreeable rather than disagreeable things should be talked about well in one sense the more or less of tension in our faces and in our unused muscles is a small thing not much mechanical work is done by these contractions but it is not always the material size of a thing that measures its importance often it is its place and function one of the most philosophical remarks i ever heard made was by an unlettered workman who was doing some repairs at my house many years ago there is very little difference between one man and another he said when you go to the bottom of it but what little there is is very important and the remark certainly applies to this case the general over contraction may be small when estimated in foot pounds but its importance is immense on account of its effects on the over contracted person s spiritual life this follows as a necessary consequence from the theory of our emotions to which i made reference at the beginning of this article for by the sensations that so incessantly pour in from the over tense excited body the over tense and excited habit of mind is kept up and the sultry threatening exhausting thunderous inner atmosphere never quite clears away if you never wholly give yourself up to the chair you sit in but always keep your leg and body muscles half contracted for a rise if you breathe eighteen or nineteen instead of sixteen times a minute and never quite breathe out at that what mental mood can you be in but one of inner panting and expectancy and how can the future and its worries possibly forsake your mind on the other hand how can they gain admission to your mind if your brow be unruffled your respiration calm and complete and your muscles all relaxed now what is the cause of this absence of repose this bottled lightning quality in us americans the explanation of it that is usually given is that it comes from the extreme dryness of our climate and the acrobatic performances of our thermometer coupled with the extraordinary progressiveness of our life the hard work the railroad speed the rapid success and all the other things we know so well by heart well our climate is certainly exciting but hardly more so than that of many parts of europe where nevertheless no bottled lightning girls are found and the work done and the pace of life are as extreme an every great capital of europe as they are here to me both of these pretended causes are utterly insufficient to explain the facts to explain them we must go not to physical geography but to psychology and sociology the latest chapter both in sociology and in psychology to be developed in a manner that approaches adequacy is the chapter on the imitative impulse first bagehot then tarde then royce and baldwin here have shown that invention and imitation taken together form one may say the entire warp and woof of human life in so far as it is social the american over tension and jerkiness and breathlessness and intensity and agony of expression are primarily social and only secondarily physiological phenomena they are bad habits nothing more or less bred of custom and example born of the imitation of bad models and the cultivation of false personal ideals how are idioms acquired how do local peculiarities of phrase and accent come about through an accidental example set by some one which struck the ears of others and was quoted and copied till at last every one in the locality chimed in just so it is with national tricks of vocalization or intonation with national manners fashions of movement and gesture and habitual expressions of face we here in america through following a succession of pattern setters whom it is now impossible to trace and through influencing each other in a bad direction have at last settled down collectively into what for better or worse is our own characteristic national type a type with the production of which so far as these habits go the climate and conditions have had practically nothing at all to do this type which we have thus reached by our imitativeness we now have fixed upon us for better or worse now no type can be wholly disadvantageous but so far as our type follows the bottled lightning fashion it cannot be wholly good dr clouston was certainly right in thinking that eagerness breathlessness and anxiety are not signs of strength they are signs of weakness and of bad co ordination the even forehead the slab like cheek the codfish eye may be less interesting for the moment but they are more promising signs than intense expression is of what we may expect of their possessor in the long run your dull unhurried worker gets over a great deal of ground because he never goes backward or breaks down your intense convulsive worker breaks down and has bad moods so often that you never know where he may be when you most need his help he may be having one of his bad days we say that so many of our fellow countrymen collapse and have to be sent abroad to rest their nerves because they work so hard i suspect that this is an immense mistake i suspect that neither the nature nor the amount of our work is accountable for the frequency and severity of our breakdowns but that their cause lies rather in those absurd feelings of hurry and having no time in that breathlessness and tension that anxiety of feature and that solicitude for results that lack of inner harmony and ease in short by which with us the work is so apt to be accompanied and from which a european who should do the same work would nine times out of ten be free these perfectly wanton and unnecessary tricks of inner attitude and outer manner in us caught from the social atmosphere kept up by tradition and idealized by many as the admirable way of life are the last straws that break the american camel s back the final overflowers of our measure of wear and tear and fatigue the voice for example in a surprisingly large number of us has a tired and plaintive sound some of us are really tired for i do not mean absolutely to deny that our climate has a tiring quality but far more of us are not tired at all or would not be tired at all unless we had got into a wretched trick of feeling tired by following the prevalent habits of vocalization and expression and if talking high and tired and living excitedly and hurriedly would only enable us to do more by the way even while breaking us down in the end it would be different there would be some compensation some excuse for going on so but the exact reverse is the case it is your relaxed and easy worker who is in no hurry and quite thoughtless most of the while of consequences who is your efficient worker and tension and anxiety and present and future all mixed up together in our mind at once are the surest drags upon steady progress and hindrances to our success my colleague professor m nsterberg an excellent observer who came here recently has written some notes on america to german papers he says in substance that the appearance of unusual energy in america is superficial and illusory being really due to nothing but the habits of jerkiness and bad co ordination for which we have to thank the defective training of our people i think myself that it is high time for old legends and traditional opinions to be changed and that if any one should begin to write about yankee inefficiency and feebleness and inability to do anything with time except to waste it he would have a very pretty paradoxical little thesis to sustain with a great many facts to quote and a great deal of experience to appeal to in its proof well my friends if our dear american character is weakened by all this over tension and i think whatever reserves you may make that you will agree as to the main facts where does the remedy lie it lies of course where lay the origins of the disease if a vicious fashion and taste are to blame for the thing the fashion and taste must be changed and though it is no small thing to inoculate seventy millions of people with new standards yet if there is to be any relief that will have to be done we must change ourselves from a race that admires jerk and snap for their own sakes and looks down upon low voices and quiet ways as dull to one that on the contrary has calm for its ideal and for their own sakes loves harmony dignity and ease so we go back to the psychology of imitation again there is only one way to improve ourselves and that is by some of us setting an example which the others may pick up and imitate till the new fashion spreads from east to west some of us are in more favorable positions than others to set new fashions some are much more striking personally and imitable so to speak but no living person is sunk so low as not to be imitated by somebody thackeray somewhere says of the irish nation that there never was an irishman so poor that he didn t have a still poorer irishman living at his expense and surely there is no human being whose example doesn t work contagiously in some particular the very idiots at our public institutions imitate each other s peculiarities and if you should individually achieve calmness and harmony in your own person you may depend upon it that a wave of imitation will spread from you as surely as the circles spread outward when a stone is dropped into a lake fortunately we shall not have to be absolute pioneers even now in new york they have formed a society for the improvement of our national vocalization and one perceives its machinations already in the shape of various newspaper paragraphs intended to stir up dissatisfaction with the awful thing that it is and better still than that because more radical and general is the gospel of relaxation as one may call it preached by miss annie payson call of boston in her admirable little volume called power through repose a book that ought to be in the hands of every teacher and student in america of either sex you need only be followers then on a path already opened up by others but of one thing be confident others still will follow you and this brings me to one more application of psychology to practical life to which i will call attention briefly and then close if one s example of easy and calm ways is to be effectively contagious one feels by instinct that the less voluntarily one aims at getting imitated the more unconscious one keeps in the matter the more likely one is to succeed become the imitable thing and you may then discharge your minds of all responsibility for the imitation the laws of social nature will take care of that result now the psychological principle on which this precept reposes is a law of very deep and wide spread importance in the conduct of our lives and at the same time a law which we americans most grievously neglect stated technically the law is this that strong feeling about one s self tends to arrest the free association of one s objective ideas and motor processes we get the extreme example of this in the mental disease called melancholia a melancholic patient is filled through and through with intensely painful emotion about himself he is threatened he is guilty he is doomed he is annihilated he is lost his mind is fixed as if in a cramp on these feelings of his own situation and in all the books on insanity you may read that the usual varied flow of his thoughts has ceased his associative processes to use the technical phrase are inhibited and his ideas stand stock still shut up to their one monotonous function of reiterating inwardly the fact of the man s desperate estate and this inhibitive influence is not due to the mere fact that his emotion is painful joyous emotions about the self also stop the association of our ideas a saint in ecstasy is as motionless and irresponsive and one idea d as a melancholiac and without going as far as ecstatic saints we know how in every one a great or sudden pleasure may paralyze the flow of thought ask young people returning from a party or a spectacle and all excited about it what it was oh it was fine it was fine it was fine is all the information you are likely to receive until the excitement has calmed down probably every one of my hearers has been made temporarily half idiotic by some great success or piece of good fortune good good good is all we can at such times say to ourselves until we smile at our own very foolishness now from all this we can draw an extremely practical conclusion if namely we wish our trains of ideation and volition to be copious and varied and effective we must form the habit of freeing them from the inhibitive influence of reflection upon them of egoistic preoccupation about their results such a habit like other habits can be formed prudence and duty and self regard emotions of ambition and emotions of anxiety have of course a needful part to play in our lives but confine them as far as possible to the occasions when you are making your general resolutions and deciding on your plans of campaign and keep them out of the details when once a decision is reached and execution is the order of the day dismiss absolutely all responsibility and care about the outcome unclamp in a word your intellectual and practical machinery and let it run free and the service it will do you will be twice as good who are the scholars who get rattled in the recitation room those who think of the possibilities of failure and feel the great importance of the act who are those who do recite well often those who are most indifferent their ideas reel themselves out of their memory of their own accord why do we hear the complaint so often that social life in new england is either less rich and expressive or more fatiguing than it is in some other parts of the world to what is the fact if fact it be due unless to the over active conscience of the people afraid of either saying something too trivial and obvious or something insincere or something unworthy of one s interlocutor or something in some way or other not adequate to the occasion how can conversation possibly steer itself through such a sea of responsibilities and inhibitions as this on the other hand conversation does flourish and society is refreshing and neither dull on the one hand nor exhausting from its effort on the other wherever people forget their scruples and take the brakes off their hearts and let their tongues wag as automatically and irresponsibly as they will they talk much in pedagogic circles to day about the duty of the teacher to prepare for every lesson in advance to some extent this is useful but we yankees are assuredly not those to whom such a general doctrine should be preached we are only too careful as it is the advice i should give to most teachers would be in the words of one who is herself an admirable teacher prepare yourself in the subject so well that it shall be always on tap then in the class room trust your spontaneity and fling away all further care my advice to students especially to girl students would be somewhat similar just as a bicycle chain may be too tight so may one s carefulness and conscientiousness be so tense as to hinder the running of one s mind take for example periods when there are many successive days of examination impending one ounce of good nervous tone in an examination is worth many pounds of anxious study for it in advance if you want really to do your best in an examination fling away the book the day before say to yourself i won t waste another minute on this miserable thing and i don t care an iota whether i succeed or not say this sincerely and feel it and go out and play or go to bed and sleep and i am sure the results next day will encourage you to use the method permanently i have heard this advice given to a student by miss call whose book on muscular relaxation i quoted a moment ago in her later book entitled as a matter of course the gospel of moral relaxation of dropping things from the mind and not caring is preached with equal success not only our preachers but our friends the theosophists and mind curers of various religious sects are also harping on this string and with the doctors the delsarteans the various mind curing sects and such writers as mr dresser prentice mulford mr horace fletcher and mr trine to help and the whole band of schoolteachers and magazine readers chiming in it really looks as if a good start might be made in the direction of changing our american mental habit into something more indifferent and strong worry means always and invariably inhibition of associations and loss of effective power of course the sovereign cure for worry is religious faith and this of course you also know the turbulent billows of the fretful surface leave the deep parts of the ocean undisturbed and to him who has a hold on vaster and more permanent realities the hourly vicissitudes of his personal destiny seem relatively insignificant things the really religious person is accordingly unshakable and full of equanimity and calmly ready for any duty that the day may bring forth this is charmingly illustrated by a little work with which i recently became acquainted the practice of the presence of god the best ruler of a holy life by brother lawrence being conversations and letters of nicholas herman of lorraine translated from the french a i extract a few passages the conversations being given in indirect discourse brother lawrence was a carmelite friar converted at paris in he said that he had been footman to m fieubert the treasurer and that he was a great awkward fellow who broke everything that he had desired to be received into a monastery thinking that he would there be made to smart for his awkwardness and the faults he should commit and so he should sacrifice to god his life with its pleasures but that god had disappointed him he having met with nothing but satisfaction in that state a fleming h revell company new york that he had long been troubled in mind from a certain belief that he should be damned that all the men in the world could not have persuaded him to the contrary but that he had thus reasoned with himself about it i engaged in a religious life only for the love of god and i have endeavored to act only for him whatever becomes of me whether i be lost or saved i will always continue to act purely for the love of god i shall have this good at least that till death i shall have done all that is in me to love him that since then he had passed his life in perfect liberty and continual joy that when an occasion of practising some virtue offered he addressed himself to god saying lord i cannot do this unless thou enablest me and that then he received strength more than sufficient that when he had failed in his duty he only confessed his fault saying to god i shall never do otherwise if you leave me to myself it is you who must hinder my failing and mend what is amiss that after this he gave himself no further uneasiness about it that he had been lately sent into burgundy to buy the provision of wine for the society which was a very unwelcome task for him because he had no turn for business and because he was lame and could not go about the boat but by rolling himself over the casks that however he gave himself no uneasiness about it nor about the purchase of the wine that he said to god it was his business he

lookin up on the incline interlude water break i got a lot to say it s been eleven minutes so far actually it hasn t it s been shorter verse how can i have a believable meaning when all of you livin in paradise livin in luxury nobody seen it or greet it but what if it s different i mean it s all seeming to be and it s in inconceivable dreaming i know it s so unbelievable being stuck in this rare unachievable feeling they givin me something i ended up leaving they givin me nothing i ended up grievin no positive side ended up seeing what life could be like from a different lead in thank god for a cover zone so i know when and where to cross it all over the place i m surprised i haven t lost it hook yeah ayy and i m feeling like i m at the top uh livin to the max now yeah that s how and i ma say it that loud i m steppin up i never back down more focused on my background and the music and how my rap sounds speak up cut the track down go till the end i don t back out stuck in the trap figure that out after i ll do the math now it s garbage take the trash out but i m here to stay till i pass out blackout verse okay it s time to go fast so sit back and relax and just maybe you ll get it about time but maybe you re mad i said it you gon pay attention cash or credit i have to let it go back a second i have some lyrics in the past that i have to edit now we re back in the middle of the track and fed it mix it up and if you talk then nah forget it we moved on walked past the exit want you to come back and pass a message never pack bags and trash you left it kinda sucks that sometimes we have to end it money never am glad i spent it if i ever had told you i m mad i meant it if you ever feel bad or sad accept it think back to the track and the rap that ben did yeah pretty obvious i m killing it if this isn t my time then maybe you need a syllabus i m feelin all the rhythm you can tell that i am into this voice is more powerful than a million instruments suddenly lyrics go demon like it s somebody else people want me to grow because of you but i m never going to level my endeavors to be better than the people that never had trust in me yeah uh hook and i m feeling like i m at the top yeah livin to the max now uh yeah that s how and i ma say it that loud i m stepping up i never back down more focused on background and the music and how my rap sounds verse speak up and they re messing with the track now people are tellin me that i m fallin short looking back at you when you re missing all the cash now and i m mad at the fact that i m not in my right mind meant to be a half decent rapper but i keep on saying all the wrong words at the right time lookin at yourself you never know what you might find lookin at the sky in the middle of the nighttime i find so much life i wonder why i can t just find mine got so many confusing questions so much knowledge i can t use the lessons i m emerging out with a new profession i ma do the best with my new perfection and i m doin it i m moving onto this future shit these hooligans are complete fools in that they just don t understand that i am through with it improvin it i m improvin it i got my brain and i m usin it and i ma make it out alive when i m playin and takin and makin this cash that i m tearing these tools to bits you re clueless ninety percent of y all ignorant keeping your minds oh so limited get off your high horse because it is time to figure it out seeming so close i can picture it now success in my drink and i m sippin it now envisioning deeper ambitions and now i ma get to it that is what living s about interlude uh god uh my voice is gone already shit alright ayy ayy ayy verse think i ve got a consensus bein lost in the trenches adolescent lessons expressin god s job is to tempt us makin it hard to stay alive it s so easy to die makin you hang your head low but say reach for the skies life is a walkin contradiction i see through its lies i m just tryna tell the stories i ve seen through its eyes i feel i m forcing and feeding of off reasons to cry with all this fake deep bullshit i m too eager to try yeah everybody sendin blessings in need of reply tryna sell their own tears for they bleedin they dry fuck your demons inside i m in need of the why so i can summarize my life through my breathing and sigh like oh well i can say that i tried hopped into life and then i stayed for the ride so many beautiful faces but they vacant inside and i m just patiently waiting for the day i decide damn this reminds me of days when i drive in l a i m screamin hi to the sky up with a smile on my face now i m hidin my face i keep tryin to trace all of the steps that i had taken to findin my place swept out to oceans so lonely waves feel like an embrace and now i m lookin at my mic like it s sent as a prophet i used to be an atheist but that turned me agnostic recently i ve been wondering if i ve fuckin lost it see my friends from kindergarten go to rehab that s the type of shit that makes you think back to simpler times blissfully ignorant minds before reality could ground us we would live in the skies and as a and as a kid i never thought i d be bein like this nah man as a kid i never thought this would even exist i felt elusive intangible just steam in the mist and now i m wakin up feelin i ain t even this shit you only look at what you got once you see that it s lost and life s too gradual for me to believe in my sauce don t understand rappers braggin i got that paper on me man i got kids in schools who doin presentations on me so what the fuck you really value tryin to take that from me to me i ll take that over rollies and makin some money rain or sunny i ma do this every day i study and write these lyrics till my brain is fuzzy damn like tyler creator tweets i just capitalize these romans tally up my hits with the capital i s this is a natural high i see it comin from afar i m still actin surprised but i ain t mastered the skies i wrote this album so much passion i actually cried they say cause i was never trappin my rap is a lie they think cause i m a awkward kid i m invalid as dj khaled s son receivin a platinum plaque for bein alive threw out half of my album it wasn t good enough shit i mean it still isn t good enough i m like a active volcano i know i could erupt but i guess i am not full enough damn i swear the higher you get that s the lower you feel man that s more shit you gotta do or you won t get a deal man that s more shit you gotta prove so they know that it s real thirty seconds of listenin thinkin you know how i feel yeah said this a motherfucking thesis statement yeah came a long way i cannot be complacent every day i wake up stressed i have to be the greatest and if not then that s a day i truly feel i ve wasted most of the pressure on my shoulders is comin from me so when i die i know i left us with something to leave so when i wake up in the morning with something to see yeah i got so much shit that i m wantin to be verse benny ben benjamin selena gomez has said if you ready come get it then everyone is jealous many want to get friends with them just in case he is relevant got iphone camera lenses to get the instagram evidence yeah i know i m way too cocky but i m workin i m figurin it all out so when people say you can t that makes you wanna get better that s benefit of the doubt i ve been on the top of this never droppin the bottom it s opposite from the positives got them from talkin often and i m locked in a pocket of all my thoughts and they keep turnin around always stoppin my songs cause they keep burnin the sound i m like yeah this is freedom of speech tryna murder all the people who be keepin the peace sacrifice your whole life cause you need a degree opportunity in front of you you need to achieve i m like nah i m just tryna find some clarity apparently it all has to do with popularity there will be obstacles primarily people blinded to what is carefully being prepared to me sometimes you ll have hilarity parody and prosperity i m askin hillary clinton to marry me powerful in the very least verse giving you all of my money but never see legacy every day that i m meant to see everyone here is impaired it is so scary and menacing but i know enemy cause i go uh walking away hopping block and what s often the case shot in the face gun locked and loaded been off at the race droppin the bass off of the place brought in a way predict what i will probably say and at the end of the day you still talking to me so obviously let the audience say so let me explain this to those who came in looking at the stages seeing a white kid thinking he s famous when they don t understand that i take risks and i make hits from basic playlist to the greatest entertaining the nation be patient whilst waiting for me to break in verse re energize got lyrics to memorize start an enterprise of better guys who cannot be successful and never try that s my dream job bein lazy just sittin with the tv on they say that i m bright like neon but i ain t takin responsibility pay me for havin limited ability with little humility but whatever i m doin it seems to be killin me i m unwillingly artistically fittin into this history tryna show you why i m better but none of you believe me tryna win this gold and try hard good game gg you beat me and now you see me in d but you can t feel me showin up on your device control option delete consider myself elite measure myself in retweets i be talkin way more chill so you can reach me instead of pretendin you understand what i am talkin bout i m the exhibit you kinda scared for like a haunted house tryna show you something instead of just sittin on the couch i ll be honest now i rarely end up walkin out into reality in normality actually happily found myself doin nothing and you don t laugh at me why cause ideally you would do the same thing nothing cause for a brain that is amazing not complainin but the best part of life is not even livin it love sleepin and just usin the internet but my time is limited and i better figure this before i m slippin this opportunity out my fingertips and let me just tell you what i have came to do tryna show you i can rap as fast as i m able to tryna show you i can hop in here like a kangaroo and say some stupid metaphors and leave after i m breakin through and if a major record label is looking at me i m a nice guy with bad teeth got a nice eye for bad beats i can rap fast and rap slow i may make mistakes but everyone has so i m like mj back when he had the afro also i m not black so maybe not but before everyone gets angry stop i m that person then people naturally hate me block all the people who keep on going crazy off cause i won t be making amazing songs in a mainstream got a lot of prominent features i m a confident speaker with some dominant teachers i deserve to be a starter but constantly on the bleachers i m awfully small achiever when i m up on the spot and eager they be fearin this every time that they hearin it to know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin a pyramid so when you re nearin this please let me know when i m standin here frozen please let it go hear the metronome combined in the compilation to unlock super stardom and move all across the nation but that is just a dream and probably a combination of a big ego and false encouragement on the way in but when i m playin just know it s all a big game i was tryna blow up bang have a big name but when you think about it it is all insane what can be created from chemicals in this brain but when you look at me you lackin respect when i m crackin my neck so that i can rap to my chest has in a breath some say that it s magic i step until i m on the same stage and you have it again but but when you think about the hall of fame you think about how people used to sit and call you names and you check and wonder if it will be all the same step back into reality it all remains damn interlude alright i just spilled water on my computer right now on my computer s breaking while i m doing this thirty thousands words shit hold on uh goddamn it verse my lyrics are not showing up on the screen you knowin just what i mean this is off the top i don t need to use no machines hold up i know i can freestyle but i can t do it forever but i am very clever okay okay i m gonna take a drink if you re watchin this take a drink too these are some shit that you can drink to but drink water unless you re of age you know what i m sayin ayy interlude okay okay uh uh ayy verse i feel like i m way too different ridiculous most of humanity s made of idiots i barely even get myself and you thinkin you understand you think hiding behind a screen gives you the upper hand please what i do is barely poetry there s hope for me i m noticing people starting to notice me but still consider me confident still consider me ready and giving out all my flawlessness but honestly all of this is haunting me probably it is just my sense of myself wobbling toppling into awfully small pieces normally all bleedin it s tragic and not fleetin it follows me all evening it s calling my name constantly makes it so hard to stay awake i close my eyes and let it go and it all fades away yeah we re just tryna find that great escape to get away from how we re living life day to day some people find it in a drink or in a cup or in some bling or in a drug or in the things that give us love but all i know is that it s tough and all i know is that this stuff isn t enough it s way too much verse i m young and ill like the dictator man what i gotta do to make the quick paper these kid haters are like ten years old but still claim to be big players that shit will make me go but i m aiming high and you aiming low got amazing rhymes and a crazy flow and i may be lyin but i came to show what i can do when i get on the mic and i m keeping it moving you said i m the hype and i m seeing it through in successes inside i don t take it for granted with plans in this life set on the wrong forgetting the right like am in my head in the lights ahead of the best of em lettin the rest of em go off to bed in the night getting it like i be livin in first class i know that you never will surpass getting the worst task for this burnt trash whenever i work fast remember the memos they sendin and sendin again and again and they never will end it and say it is splendid but never relented and every sentence i say is perfected take a deep breath cause i need that most of y all don t even care what i m saying you really just like how i speak fast my bars are meta i got meta bars with meta eights and metaphors you want better cores and better cars but you don t know what i m headin towards say that i am the king of this shit crazy rhymes they ain t thinkin of this i m singin and rappin and makin it happen and makin you laugh when i m bringin this shit tryna find the other way y all just waiting for another day cause what other fourteen year old had hit k i m making the most of a crazier flow so many ways it could go i m taking the throne and you chillin and stayin at home i m willing to make it my own i m bakin my cake and you know that i m eating it even if staying up late is the needed bit reason is stayin the same i m just fleein it leavin my life while i m seeing these seasons switch meaning these people ain t feelin rich reach in the fire i m heatin it pleasin these liars they ve peaked and so now they re recedin agreein to be a live without leading it flow s so dope i think it s time that we take a break we all make mistakes and play some hate i got s here to save the day cause i am on top of it lost in my thoughts and i gotta be stoppin it rockin it you know my flow is so dominant positive confident full of accomplishments compliments all of these offers is boring as fuck though i am not a part of em start a new part to the charts and i gotta be sure this art is the star on the map when i m starting it breaking it up like cartilage flow is so crazy it s dope and you know it i know that you hate to admit it but really this shit is the business rhymes keep darkenin under the radar you don t know what s comin i m comin right up and your bitch started runnin i found to be part of a little of something called love and i guess that s the art of it i try to go slow but it don t work gettin better and that don t hurt and you think i m dead and you re sure you re salty and not kosher slave to the corporates and the owners this is live and love call it shrek like the ogre hah bitch i have had enough and i am sure i ain t mad enough forgettin the rest while i m gettin success and i look at the numbers i add em up my chart is like a parabola thank you a lot for havin us and so every day i take one step up man i am takin the ladder up hundred k get the plaque lookin forward not heading back remember what i had said is that we ain t givin up remember that hit me up when you re done whining i ll hit you up when i m done rhyming listen up cause i m combining all my skills into one finding we run grinding you know we do we got the shit that we re goin through these lyrics go over you you don t listen so you don t know it s true cause we in and we ve done it thousands now we a hundred shoutout to didac and momo and the others shit i consider them brothers shit i consider you all are my family shoutout to those who will stand with me even when all of the others abandon me yeah drama we move past that now i look at you with the last laugh better trackback now i rap fast so many skills in my backpack started off so terribly now all of these people compare to me in the past i never anticipated what there would be and see ya so long now off to the end of the song now see ya next at five hundred and a million it s on now interlude it s on now oh shit i m almost out of water this is a hard this a real challenge this like physically difficult ayy hook when i walk up in the scene i hear a orchestra now everybody telling me i don t perform enough my math teacher told me that i d never be shit and now i m searched more then the quadratic formula i got the formula i got the formula you got the sauce but goddamn i got the formula ayy people always asking ben why you record so much i got to fry up all these rappers quick like order up verse formula like i m mr krabs i change and transform it up you stuck in the past yeah i wear supreme goggles to my science lab uh it hurts to write this song cause i don t like to brag and now i ve tied myself up like a nike mag people love to criticize me for the life i ve had they make it bout white and black like i m michael jack i make these haters look confused like it s dora asking where swipper at ayy uh bitch i m supreme cause i got it on me now they copy that like a walkie talkie and i m feelin like they really want to stop me tryna fold my paper like it s origami wanna justify the hate they call me cocky and i am cause your girl call me papi tryna take ti t uh paparazzi i m a fax machine up in a lot of copies ayy still saying who would a thought like who would a guessed it haven t lifted weights in two years but somehow i m always flexing if you really want to find the answer to your question here is where you should look want the secret to the sauce motherfucker better go and find a cookbook verse ayy they doubt a fucker with a dream looking to the stars for some money and a scheme yeah looking at the cars all the hundreds and the greens serpent s told you no and it s like nothing s as it seems god damn i guess i really thought he was the man i guess i really thought he had some fans but that shit is all a sham all that cash he stocked was from a scam all the views he got was from some spam i ve been living like man ain t why he been doin what he can why ain t he just sticking to the plan how has he been living with no limits getting millions by the minutes i don t get it i don t really understand i ve been living like damn he ain t getting money by the gram i ll do better if i study my exams do i really wanna stand next to all these average fucking sad duds so i hate this motherfucker with a dream cause he has one hook yeah hate a motherfucker with a dream cause he has one ayy just because you gave up doesn t mean i m a backup uh uh uh feel all my good times get replaced by the bad ones and so they hate a motherfucker with a dream cause he verse cause he been living this passion i ma just sit and imagine i ve got a bitch on my lap and she listen to rap and she really been digging my track and i m livin for snap that shit invisible now i m unoriginal now i m making a minimum wage this is literal aids and i m needin to figure this out how did i get to the stage i wanna get up on stage do this shit everyday and i won t care bout whatever they say let em all pester away but

shit but we ain t over we ain t done though am i takin a break are you dumb bro well we nearin k but i still need k while all you sit around i would rather work than play lyrics go through your dome through your vertebrae hit you back and forth till you end up at the pearly gates interlude that was actually a pretty good bar i just wrote that like right a second ago before i recorded this ayy ayy you know just to add some fill stuff in uh hook sometimes i don t know what to think sometimes i don t know what ll make it okay make it okay i m snorin all day for dreams yeah ayy verse uh i wake up pondering damn my mind is wandering all these opportunities left squandered in my oxygen all accomplishments left haunted in my lack of confidence often is the result of falling under consciousness you d make babies cry i make crazy lives you re just angry cause you re livin in a fading lie and i ve been feeling this energy feeling that somebody s getting the penalty fearing that one day you ll end up ahead of me feeling that this is the end of me no will i tell you no never i think i m so clever but in the grand scheme of things i know that i m no better but i don t ever want to go to show just one mo letter i m a go getter i go get a s and get grades and get a s then wake up and get c s but get paid uh my life is so unusual to most it isn t suitable to me it s irrefutable can t see me in a cubicle i d rather watch my funeral i d rather go back to stab my own brains out back in utero uh but you know that i m capable you know i ma pounce at any chance that is available feeling so unique and i think it s not explainable no one hears my lyrics and says omg relatable no that s not what i m here to give been waiting years for this you re about to experience something that i ve spent time money and thought on learned about all the times money had thought wrong kinda funny it s long gone but time is crummy and not long i ain t lucky i m not calm not by a long shot out on the inside see me on the outside always think i m positive and never see the downsides it s bout time you know the truth you couldn t be further from it get your head out your own ass you couldn t be further up it interlude okay okay okay we re like thirty minutes in thirty minutes but we got thirty thousand bro fuck verse yeah i m the key to the equation bitch you better beware i m like the e that equals all other emcees squared i m just me performing in front of empty chairs but y all see so all of y all better get prepared i got so much opportunity i gotta make the most of it shoes made

background they re shouting set kevin free charles keith they re just trying to speed everything up so the media don t catch up attorney james banks they re relying merely upon the fact that it was a large black man that they saw in the project area and then being shown pictures of kevin and a person saying yeah that s the person i saw that night if that s the information they re relying on that s not too accurate news clip three other shot at the south bucyrus apartment did not die and now our sources say the survivors all three of them have identified kevin keith as the gunman ruth keith i

system is so fucked up kevin keith what else can we do we can just get the story out there and hope that you know it gives people you know i don t know i don t know kim i m just tired i m at that point to where i m tired and so i don t know kim kardashian the case of kevin keith and the bucyrus estates is deeply twisted and incredibly heartbreaking from all sides but before i tell you about this case let me explain why you re hearing it from me the sound effect from the show celebrity family feud plays steve harvey welcome back to celebrity family feud everybody the kardashian family once again kim kardashian i did the show family feud a few years back and one of the producers came up to me and said that he had a case people always ask me like oh my god do you have a second like they want to talk to you about this case of like a family member or someone that s really close to them and one of the producers came up to me and they pitched me kevin keith s case casette player button is pressed and the tape starts playing news clip it s been described as one of the worst murder cases and bucyrus history six people were gunned down two died instantly and a third died less than an hour after the incident noise sound from switching the tapes another clip keith is charged with three counts of aggravated murder which carry death penalty specifications and three counts of attempted murder he said from the beginning he s innocent casette player button is pressed again kim kardashian i ve only been on the case about a year it really spoke to me the whole situation sucks and i just don t feel like he was given a fair shot the sound of going through and flipping pages is heard lori rothschild sometimes it s like i sound like i m bullshitting you like i like this is the reason why i m so passionate about the case it s like unbelievable to think that all of this exists in a file somewhere and how come i m the one looking through it it s like no look at it with me i m not laughs i ll show it to you too kim kardashian i met lori through the producer at family feud lori rothschild my name is lori rothschild and i am a television producer and i specialize in true crime television kim kardashian and so she came over with a huge notebook of details and information all about the case it seems like she knew this case in and out better than any investigator i ve ever met and so when i sat down with her i was so into it and i asked her if i can keep her notebook which was like her prized possession lori rothschild let me just pull this really quick it s a labor of love this thing kim kardashian and i just said can i keep it through the weekend so i can just read through all of the evidence i really want to like dig into this case and she left it with me and i gave it back to her on the monday and i was like i m in lori rothschild i mean it s still a work in progress so i think it s six years of paperwork that has been accumulated in this binder kim kardashian there s been so much work put into this there s been so many people that have tried to help kevin lori rothschild i create these big binders to help me because there s so many small details especially you know as an investigation happens looking at a police report if you if you read it in a linear fashion from top to bottom page to page you think you re getting all the information from that right but it s like when did they say that is really important in a case like this you have to follow the dates not just the police reporting but following the dates on all the reports actually create the timeline for you to be able to see where the mistakes have been made kim kardashian this timeline sounds straightforward at first but the deeper we go the more the reported events of february th are called into question pay attention to what s said here because it s the backbone of the case these details will come up later and not everyone has the same story sound of casette tape fast forwarding is played again voice over on the night before valentine s day in the town of bucyrus ohio a man approached apartment b of the bucyrus estates complex sometime between and pm six people were there that night in the apartment marichell chatman her four year old daughter marchae and her boyfriend richard warren who had been living with her for the past few weeks marichell was also babysitting her younger cousins that night seven year old quanita reeves and four year old quentin reeves around pm marichell s aunt linda chatman stopped by to pick up quanita and quentin on behalf of their mom joyce reeves shortly after this time a man started lingering around the door of the chatman s apartment richard warren opened the door and the man asked to speak to linda linda let him inside the man engaged in some brief small talk about the basketball game on tv then he asked for a glass of water which linda got for him richard warren described the man as having a turtleneck pulled up through his nose covering his mouth warren reported that the man drank the glass of water through the fabric after finishing the glass the man pulled a gun out of the plastic bag he was carrying he ordered everyone to get on the floor marichell pleaded with the man not to hurt them to which he responded with something along the lines of well you should have thought about this before your brothers started ratting on people then the armed man opened fire into the small apartment and fled the scene richard warren though wounded was able to stand and make a run for it he ran towards a nearby restaurant named ike s screaming for help the gunman fired at richard again outside striking him once more and causing him to fall onto the snow in her first statement to the police a neighbor named nancy smathers reported seeing a large stocky black male leave thehome in a hurry and get into a light cream colored car the man revved the engine and peeled out attempting to leave quickly however smathers said he quickly lodged the car in a snowbank smathers reported seeing him rock back and forth to shake the car free from the snow before speeding away successfully smathers said the man she witnessed wore dark clothing a winter coat and a hat she stated that his face was not covered but she couldn t make out any discernible details richard warren bleeding from his multiple gunshot wounds finally reached the nearby restaurant ike s at pm a call was placed richard warren was rushed to the emergency department of grant medical center while quanita quentin and marchae were brought to the children s hospital year old linda chatman and year old marichell chatman were pronounced dead at the scene four year old marchae chatman died later that night at the hospital the sound of casette player play button being pressed news clip police chief joe baron says a single gunman opened fire on the little girl and two women in their apartment complex sunday night the shooting which occurred around pm also left three others wounded ike s worker i looked inside and i just seen the bodies laying on the floor two inside one to the right one to the left and two smaller bodies one in front of the couch bent back another one on its side over towards the tv no movement or nothing it just made me sick when i opened that door seeing them little kids casette player stop button is pressed voice over two days later kevin keith was arrested at his fiance s home in crestline ohio and taken into custody he was charged with three counts of aggravated murder as well as three counts of attempted aggravated murder kevin keith was never questioned by the police the sound of prison bars closing is heard noise from the crowed protesting and shouting from the outside is heard news clip the protesters lined the sidewalk in front of the crawford county courthouse to show their support for kevin keith charged with murdering a bucyrus family on february the th kim kardashian kevin keith s trial began on may th of only three months later this is unbelievably and concerningly fast for a capital murder trial kevin was represented by defense attorney james banks banks had never worked on a capital murder case before gavel sound news clip keith was charged with three counts of aggravated murder which carry death penalty specifications and three counts of attempted murder he said from the beginning he s innocent news clip keith who was accompanied by defense counsel james banks of columbus maintains his innocence and claims it s a mistaken identity news reporter how would they come up with something like that kevin keith i don t have any idea news reporter fair of me to say who you think did all this kevin keith i wouldn t have any idea who would do something like this especially in this area and it would take somebody was crazy and i don t know anybody like that around here that would hurt those kids kim kardashian there was lack of physical evidence presented during trial that explicitly linked kevin keith to the crime such as forensic evidence or a weapon news clip defense attorney james banks said the state lacks evidence including the murder weapon attorney james banks they searched the apartment where the crime was committed they considered fingerprints they considered glass samples fiber samples and yet not one piece of evidence was retrieved that would point to kevin keith kim kardashian the trial lasted two weeks news clip presiding judge nelfred g kimerline will give the jury as long as it needs to reach a verdict in the kevin keith murder trial in bucyrus judge kimerline otherwise you can go for as long as you want to we re certainly not pushing to arrive at a decision kim kardashian kevin s friends and family express concern that the jury selected was all white especially considering that the key witness surviving victim richard warren was also white in fact richard warren was the only victim that wasn t black news clip keith s family and friends are still professing his innocence and some are questioning the decision of an all white jury gracie keith we re very hurt banks presented a good case i don t think they heard they heard anything i don t know what the jury heard what they thought but we know that this is a racist town news clip keith s family chanted we love you kevin as he was led out of the courtroom and back to the crawford county jail where he s been since his arrest february th if convicted keith could die in the electric chair kim kardashian for kevin s friends and family the outcome was the worst imaginable news reporter his execution day is set how do you feel ruth keith is heard in the background indignantly saying how do i feel charles keith we expected it we expected all of this kim kardashian this is the voice of kevin s older brother charles keith kevin s biggest advocate charles keith and it seems like we went back to warren s testimony to sink him when the prosecutor himself said indeed he warren cannot identify kevin with certainty now how can he remember a speech you re talking about fabrication ruth keith they lied everybody got on that stand and testified lied and everybody was in there listening knew that even including to judge kimerline reporter russ did you expect the outcome today to be what it was russell wiseman no i expected it because there was no there was no mitigating factors present in the case kim kardashian this is russell wiseman the prosecutor who presented the state s case against kevin russell wiseman given the the manner in which the crime was carried out the motive for the crime and the lack of any explanation for or excuse i really wasn t surprised like i say i don t take any joy in these kinds of cases i wish it never happened but under ohio law i think the jury made the right decision news clip keith s execution date is february the one year anniversary of the slayings reporting for wmfd i m rhonda davis casette player stop button being pressed and the break sound effect is played kim kardashian the court ultimately ruled that kevin should serve the death penalty for the three murder convictions and also serve a seven to year prison term for each of the attempted aggravated murder convictions of course he wouldn t finish serving that time before he was executed as kevin sat on death row he watched his petitions and appeals be continuously denied by the court system eventually he fired his lawyers and took the case upon himself for a while his brother charles helped him investigate in kevin sought new representation in rachel troutman assistant state public defender in the year of kevin s scheduled execution troutman petition for clemency only a higher governmental power could change kevin s fate and now it rested in the hands of ohio governor ted strickland news clip state defense attorney says new evidence clears him rachel troutman the ohio parole board must recommend and governor strickland must grant clemency for mr keith any other result will be irreversible sickening and a tragic mistake news clip keith s brother charles helped deliver signatures to governor ted strickland tuesday urging him to stop next month s planned execution kim kardashian finally governor strickland commuted kevin s death sentence only days before kevin was scheduled to be executed now kevin is serving a life sentence at the marion correctional institution in other words though kevin narrowly escaped capital punishment he is facing life in prison and in his mind it s another slower death sentence today kevin s legal team is preparing to file for clemency for parole a process in which a higher authority in this case the ohio governor mike dewine would be considering kevin s case for a reduced sentence or reinstated rights kevin keith his family and his legal team are hoping for a pardon a commutation to time served which would release them immediately or at the very least the possibility of parole lori rothschild this case actually is the very first case i ever opened as a wrongful conviction that i ever even considered to be a part of kim kardashian again this is lori rothschild lori rothschild it crossed my desk through another case i was working on i remember my friends saying you should look into the case of kevin keith do you know the kevin keith case and i said i don t i don t know it s a wrongful conviction case my thought in my mind it will everyone says they re innocent and how hard is it to prove that someone actually didn t commit a crime they were convicted by a jury of their peers you know this is the system that i believed in because i came from a law enforcement family i think the first piece of information that i saw was that a local cleveland magazine had done an article on kevin keith in this article they talk about another person being paid to commit this crime and the police knew about it in me just looking into that part of it it started the twist of all of the other things that were so wrong with this case and i also realized that that information about that other person being paid to commit the crime didn t come out until like kevin was convicted and the crime happened in and that s how he got his clemency why didn t they give him life with parole you re just basically leaving someone in prison to die kim kardashian was someone paid to commit this crime i was intrigued by this like lori said that information didn t surface until over years after the crime took place we ll get into the alternative suspects later but there s a lot of ground we should cover first skype video call sound effect is heard key is pressed to answer kim kardashian hello hi guys erin haney and jessica jackson hi hi kim kim kardashian so i have another case that i want you guys to look at and see what you think it s a case in bucyrus ohio and it s about kevin keith who was sentenced to death for a triple homicide a family was involved i have read over all of the evidence his sentence was commuted so he was relieved of the actual death penalty pretty close kim kardashian right now you re hearing me discuss kevin keith s case with my personal legal team which includes attorneys erin haney and jessica jackson these are the two same attorneys that i worked with on my first wrongful conviction case that i took on the alice johnson case alice johnson my name is alice johnson i m a years old mother grandmother and great grandmother kim kardashian and she was in prison a life sentence without the possibility of parole for a nonviolent drug offense that was her first offense when i looked at it i just didn t understand how their first time nonviolent drug offense got the same exact sentence as charles manson like that to me didn t make sense and i thought okay there s something wrong with our system so i sent the video to one of my attorneys sean hawley who actually was an attorney on the oj case with my dad and we always stayed connected we looked into it and i thought well what can i do who can change this everyone told me that the president that donald trump was the only one that can commute her sentence and give her a pardon and so i was advised by a friend to call ivanka and she connected me with her husband jared kushner who reviewed the case looked at all over brought it to the president and within a few months we got her sentence commuted news clip after more than years behind bars this was alice marie johnson s first full day of freedom she was released from federal prison in alabama late yesterday after president trump commuted her life sentence on a drug conviction mr trump tweeted today good luck to alice johnson have a wonderful life alice johnson i m feeling no handcuffs nothing on me i m free to hug my family kim kardashian that was just like unheard of that we were able to get that done and i couldn t just stop at that i saw how successful we were with that and i want to just do more so i figured like alice was the face to show people hey like it s okay if we let people out see she s a sweet great grandmother that like would never harm anybody and to me that put the face on reform and why people deserve to be out alice johnson never in my wildest dreams did i think that it will be kim kardashian who would take my cause on news reporter in prison yesterday she got a call it was kardashian west alice johnson when she say at home just that word i could go home now i started screaming and jumping and erin haney so he he has i think right life without parole though right wasn t that that what they commuted it to which would mean he would never get a chance to be free so part of what you re doing it sounds like is trying to get enough attention and support so that he would have a chance at justice and freedom kim kardashian recording this all interviewing him his brother anyone that would talk to us on the other side all sides and creating a podcast maybe from hearing this someone will come forward maybe just by publicizing this kevin keith there are reasons to be on outside right okay i mean think about this this is what haunts me okay this is what haunts me this is where my demons come in and that is the fact that i could have been executed in september th my attorneys rachel and my attorneys came up with all this information a lot of this new information after the fact now they came up with a lot of information before that you would affect the court judicial system and saying wait a minute let s put the brakes on this okay okay we ll give them that but since then they ve come up with all this information that the state was using against me to prove my innocence and i m still sitting here so that s the judicial system for me kim kardashian i know and that s the case for so many people and it s so unfair and it like infuriates me i mean i it i can only imagine how you feel and i can t even begin to put myself in your shoes kevin keith i just didn t think that you could be made a victim by the judicial system i didn t know the judicial system would actually create a victim kim kardashian like it seems like it s stuff that just happens in the movies like you really don t think it s a reality kevin keith exactly and especially when it s clear it s just they then broke everything down now they ve exposed everything and i m still sitting here years later i m probably only tell one person and use this word that i m innocent and the reason for that is because people don t want to hear especially from outside they don t want to hear it but they frankly like everything they bring around is innocent that s what they say but that is the reality of the situation there s not too many guys i ve met over the years say their innocent but i say that to say i can t approach young people and encourage them with the narrative of i m a victim even though i m a victim because in order for me to reach them i could not complain this is what i mean by sometimes i m overwhelmed because i had to go with the responsibility i talked a lot of time recovery service that i volunteer at and chair meetings and things like that and so the first thing i do is i take responsibility because i teach this program called boyhood to manhood and this is rites of passage program and so six of the principles that we stress to the guys is authority responsibility and the sacrements imitations repentance and courage those are the six principles so with those principles right there i gotta stand on those principles and always go back to me and because of my generation a lot of young guys that i m talking about locked up in prison their fathers are my age so we kind of dropped the ball on these young guys so the first thing i had to do coming out the box i gotta take responsibility for myself and for their fathers so that they got a connection because a lot of them didn t have that so now when they look at me i don t want them to see a victim i want them to see somebody that makes some bad choices in his life okay taking responsibility for those choices and moving forward kim kardashian you ve heard a lot of pretty unbelievable things about this case by now how there was a lack of physical evidence how the jury may have been stacked against kevin how a report surfaced later and highlighted another potential suspect and that s just scratching the surface there are a lot of details that haven t been available to the general public and that s my goal to make sure that you can all hear the facts and make your own determination because sometimes our system is not as trustworthy as we re led to believe we ll get into all of these topics and more during this podcast but as i said before this case is not black and white and there s more than one side to this story damon chatman talk about them i talked about them all the time i talk about them to my friends how much i miss them you know and a lot of the good times we had together and stuff and then i wish i just wish they were still here kim kardashian this is damon chatman victim marichell chatman s brother damon chatman when i heard about it somebody called me maybe call me or text me i don t know but and they was like i think it was a shooting at the bucyrus estates and we ve been oh we re on our way over there now soon as we get over we see all the police over there by my sister s house uh we run in there the police tried to stop me from going into the apartments they wasn t stopping i go in there my sister was laying beside my aunt and my niece was running up she was running up steps she was face down face down on the steps with two shots in her back i mean i will never forget it never me and my cousin charles yolanda s son knew who did as soon as we walked in there we knew it we both looked at each other once they made us come outside and then charles looked at each other and was like kevin did this and we knew it we knew kevin did it kim kardashian i m kim kardashian and this is the system credits narrated by kim the system the case of kevin keith is a spotify original series

how many weak shows you slept through time s up i m sorry i kept you thinking of this you keep repeating you miss the rhymes from the microphone soloist so you sit by the radio hand on the dial soon as you hear it pump up the volume dance with the speaker till you hear it blow then plug in the headphone cause here it go it s a four letter word when it s heard it control your body to dance you got it soul ditects the tempo like a red alert reaches your reflex and let it work when this is playing you can t get stuck with the steps so get set and i m a still come up with a gift to be swift follow the leader the rhyme will go def with the record that was mixed a long time ago it can be done but only i can do it for those that can t dance just clap your hands to it i start to think and then i

time an ambitious young reporter from new york arrived one morning at gatsby s door and asked him if he had anything to say anything to say about what inquired gatsby politely why any statement to give out it transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard gatsby s name around his office in a connection which he either wouldn t reveal or didn t fully understand this was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hurried out to see it was a random shot and yet the reporter s instinct was right gatsby s notoriety spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities on his past had increased all summer until he fell just short of being news contemporary legends such as the underground pipe line to canada attached themselves to him and there was one persistent story that he didn t live in a house at all but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the long island shore just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to james gatz of north dakota isn t easy to say james gatz that was really or at least legally his name he had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his career when he saw dan cody s yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on lake superior it was james gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants but it was already jay gatsby who borrowed a rowboat pulled out to the tuolomee and informed cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour i suppose he d had the name ready for a long time even then his parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people his imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all the truth was that jay gatsby of west egg long island sprang from his platonic conception of himself he was a son of god a phrase which if it means anything means just that and he must be about his father s business the service of a vast vulgar and meretricious beauty so he invented just the sort of jay gatsby that a seventeen year old boy would be likely to invent and to this conception he was faithful to the end for over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of lake superior as a clam digger and a salmon fisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and bed his brown hardening body lived naturally through the half fierce half lazy work of the bracing days he knew women early and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them of young virgins because they were ignorant of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming self absorbtion he took for granted but his heart was in a constant turbulent riot the most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night a universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the wash stand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace for a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy s wing an instinct toward his future glory had led him some months before to the small lutheran college of st olaf in southern minnesota he stayed there two weeks dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny to destiny itself and despising the janitor s work with which he was to pay his way through then he drifted back to lake superior and he was still searching for something to do on the day that dan cody s yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore cody was fifty years old then a product of the nevada silver fields of the yukon of every rush for metal since seventy five the transactions in montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of soft mindedness and suspecting this an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money the none too savory ramifications by which ella kaye the newspaper woman played madame de maintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht were common knowledge to the turgid sub journalism of he had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as james gatz s destiny at little girls bay to the young gatz resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck the yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world i suppose he smiled at cody he had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled at any rate cody asked him a few questions one of them elicited the brand new name and found that he was quick and extravagantly ambitious a few days later he took him to duluth and bought him a blue coat six pair of white duck trousers and a yachting cap and when the tuolomee left for the west indies and the barbary coast gatsby left too he was employed in a vague personal capacity while he remained with cody he was in turn steward mate skipper secretary and even jailor for dan cody sober knew what lavish doings dan cody drunk might soon be about and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in gatsby the arrangement lasted five years during which the boat went three times around the continent it might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that ella kaye came on board one night in boston and a week later dan cody inhospitably died i remember the portrait of him up in gatsby s bedroom a gray florid man with a hard empty face the pioneer debauchee who during one phase of american life brought back to the eastern seaboard the savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon it was indirectly due to cody that gatsby drank so little sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone and it was from cody that he inherited money a legacy of twenty five thousand dollars he didn t get it he never understood the legal device that was used against him but what remained of the millions went intact to ella kaye he was left with his singularly appropriate education the vague contour of jay gatsby had filled out to the substantiality of a man he told me all this very much later but i ve put it down here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumors about his antecedents which weren t even faintly true moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion when i had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him so i take advantage of this short halt while gatsby so to speak caught his breath to clear this set of misconceptions away it was a halt too in my association with his affairs for several weeks i didn t see him or hear his voice on the phone mostly i was in new york trotting around with jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt but finally i went over to his house one sunday afternoon i hadn t been there two minutes when somebody brought tom buchanan in for a drink i was startled naturally but the really surprising thing was that it hadn t happened before they were a party of three on horseback tom and a man named sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding habit who had been there previously i m delighted to see you said gatsby standing on his porch i m delighted that you dropped in as though they cared sit right down have a cigarette or a cigar he walked around the room quickly ringing bells i ll have something to drink for you in just a minute he was profoundly affected by the fact that tom was there but he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for mr sloane wanted nothing a lemonade no thanks a little champagne nothing at all thanks i m sorry did you have a nice ride very good roads around here i suppose the automobiles yeah moved by an irresistible impulse gatsby turned to tom who had accepted the introduction as a stranger i believe we ve met somewhere before mr buchanan oh yes said tom gruffly polite but obviously not remembering so we did i remember very well about two weeks ago that s right you were with nick here i know your wife continued gatsby almost aggressively that so tom turned to me you live near here nick next door that so mr sloane didn t enter into the conversation but lounged back haughtily in his chair the woman said nothing either until unexpectedly after two highballs she became cordial we ll all come over to your next party mr gatsby she suggested what do you say certainly i d be delighted to have you be ver nice said mr sloane without gratitude well think ought to be starting home please don t hurry gatsby urged them he had control of himself now and he wanted to see more of tom why don t you why don t you stay for supper i wouldn t be surprised if some other people dropped in from new york you come to supper with me said the lady enthusiastically both of you this included me mr sloane got to his feet come along he said but to her only i mean it she insisted i d love to have you lots of room gatsby looked at me questioningly he wanted to go and he didn t see that mr sloane had determined he shouldn t i m afraid i won t be able to i said well you come she urged concentrating on gatsby mr sloane murmured something close to her ear we won t be late if we start now she insisted aloud i haven t got a horse said gatsby i used to ride in the army but i ve never bought a horse i ll have to follow you in my car excuse me for just a minute the rest of us walked out on the porch where sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside my god i believe the man s coming said tom doesn t he know she doesn t want him she says she does want him she has a big dinner party and he won t know a soul there he frowned i wonder where in the devil he met daisy by god i may be old fashioned in my ideas but women run around too much these days to suit me they meet all kinds of crazy fish suddenly mr sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses come on said mr sloane to tom we re late we ve got to go and then to me tell him we couldn t wait will you tom and i shook hands the rest of us exchanged a cool nod and they trotted quickly down the drive disappearing under the august foliage just as gatsby with hat and light overcoat in hand came out the front door tom was evidently perturbed at daisy s running around alone for on the following saturday night he came with her to gatsby s party perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness it stands out in my memory from gatsby s other parties that summer there were the same people or at least the same sort of people the same profusion of champagne the same many colored many keyed commotion but i felt an unpleasantness in the air a pervading harshness that hadn t been there before or perhaps i had merely grown used to it grown to accept west egg as a world complete in itself with its own standards and its own great figures second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so and now i was looking at it again through daisy s eyes it is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment they arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds daisy s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat these things excite me so she whispered if you want to kiss me any time during the evening nick just let me know and i ll be glad to arrange it for you just mention my name or present a green card i m giving out green look around suggested gatsby i m looking around i m having a marvelous you must see the faces of many people you ve heard about tom s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd we don t go around very much he said in fact i was just thinking i don t know a soul here perhaps you know that lady gatsby indicated a gorgeous scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white plum tree tom and daisy stared with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies she s lovely said daisy the man bending over her is her director he took them ceremoniously from group to group mrs buchanan and mr buchanan after an instant s hesitation he added the polo player oh no objected tom quickly not me but evidently the sound of it pleased gatsby for tom remained the polo player for the rest of the evening i ve never met so many celebrities daisy exclaimed i liked that man what was his name with the sort of blue nose gatsby identified him adding that he was a small producer well i liked him anyhow i d a little rather not be the polo player said tom pleasantly i d rather look at all these famous people in in oblivion daisy and gatsby danced i remember being surprised by his graceful conservative fox trot i had never seen him dance before then they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour while at her request i remained watchfully in the garden in case there s a fire or a flood she explained or any act of god tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together do you mind if i eat with some people over here he said a fellow s getting off some funny stuff go ahead answered daisy genially and if you want to take down any addresses here s my little gold pencil she looked around after a moment and told me the girl was common but pretty and i knew that except for the half hour she d been alone with gatsby she wasn t having a good time we were at a particularly tipsy table that was my fault gatsby had been called to the phone and i d enjoyed these same people only two weeks before but what had amused me then turned septic on the air now how do you feel miss baedeker the girl addressed was trying unsuccessfully to slump against my shoulder at this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes wha a massive and lethargic woman who had been urging daisy to play golf with her at the local club to morrow spoke in miss baedeker s defence oh she s all right now when she s had five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that i tell her she ought to leave it alone i do leave it alone affirmed the accused hollowly we heard you yelling so i said to doc civet here there s somebody that needs your help doc she s much obliged i m sure said another friend without gratitude but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool anything i hate is to get my head stuck in a pool mumbled miss baedeker they almost drowned me once over in new jersey then you ought to leave it alone countered doctor civet speak for yourself cried miss baedeker violently your hand shakes i wouldn t let you operate on me it was like that almost the last thing i remember was standing with daisy and watching the moving picture director and his star they were still under the white plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale thin ray of moonlight between it occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity and even while i watched him stoop to one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek i like her said daisy i think she s lovely but the rest offended her and inarguably because it wasn t a gesture but an emotion she was appalled by west egg this unprecedented place that broadway had begotten upon a long island fishing village appalled by its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short cut from nothing to nothing she saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand i sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car it was dark here in front only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning sometimes a shadow moved agains a dressing room blind above gave way to another shadow an indefinite procession of shadows that rouged and powdered in an invisible glass who is this gatsby anyhow demanded tom suddenly some big bootlegger where d you hear that i inquired i didn t hear it i imagined it a lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers you know not gatsby i said shortly he was silent for a moment the pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet well he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together a breeze stirred the gray haze of daisy s fur collar at least they re more interesting than the people we know she said with an effort you didn t look so interested well i was tom laughed and turned to me did you notice daisy s face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold shower daisy began to sing with the music in a husky rhythmic whisper bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again when the melody rose her voice broke up sweetly following it in a way contralto voices have and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air lots of people come who haven t been invited she said suddenly that girl hadn t been invited they simply force their way in and he s too polite to object i d like to know who he is and what he does insisted tom and i think i ll make a point of finding out i can tell you right now she answered he owned some drug stores a lot of drug stores he built them up himself the dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive good night nick said daisy her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps where three o clock in the morning a neat sad little waltz of that year was drifting out the open door after all in the very casualness of gatsby s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world what was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside what would happen now in the dim incalculable hours perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at gatsby one moment of magical encounter would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion i stayed late that night gatsby asked me to wait until he was free and i lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up chilled and exalted from the black beach until the lights were extinguished in the guest rooms overhead when he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face and his eyes were bright and tired she didn t like it he said immediately of course she did she didn t like it he insisted she didn t have a good time he was silent and i guessed at his unutterable depression i feel far away from her he said it s hard to make her understand you mean about the dance the dance he dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of his fingers old sport the dance is unimportant he wanted nothing less of daisy than that she should go to tom and say i never loved you after she had obliterated four years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken one of them was that after she was free they were to go back to louisville and be married from her house just as if it were five years ago and she doesn t understand he said she used to be able to understand we d sit for hours he broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favors and crushed flowers i wouldn t ask too much of her i ventured you can t repeat the past can t repeat the past he cried incredulously why of course you can he looked around him wildly as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house just out of reach of his hand i m going to fix everything just the way it was before he said nodding determinedly she ll see he talked a lot about the past and i gathered that he wanted to recover something some idea of himself perhaps that had gone into loving daisy his life had been confused and disordered since then but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly he could find out what that thing was one autumn night five years before they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight they stopped here and turned toward each other now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year the quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars out of the corner of his eye gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees he could climb to it if he climbed alone and once there he could suck on the pap of life gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder his heart beat faster and faster as daisy s white face came up to his own he knew that when he kissed this girl and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath his mind would never romp again like the mind of god so he waited listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star then he kissed her at his lips touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete through all he said even through his appalling sentimentality i was reminded of something an elusive rhythm a fragment of lost words that i had heard somewhere a long time ago for a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man s as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air but they made no sound and what i had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever embed,"['uneasy',

the shadow of the waxwing slain by the false azure in the windowpane i was the smudge of ashen fluff and i lived on flew on in the reflected sky and from the inside too i d duplicate myself my lamp an apple on a plate uncurtaining the night i d let dark glass hang all the furniture above the grass and how delightful when a fall of snow covered my glimpse of lawn and reached up so as to make chair and bed exactly stand upon that snow out in that crystal land retake the falling snow each drifting flake shapeless and slow unsteady and opaque a dull dark white against the day s pale white and abstract larches in the neutral light and then the gradual and dual blue as night unites the viewer and the view and in the morning diamonds of frost express amazement whose spurred feet have crossed from left to right the blank page of the road reading from left to right in winter s code a dot an arrow pointing back repeat dot arrow pointing back a pheasant s feet torquated beauty sublimated grouse finding your china right behind my house was he in sherlock holmes the fellow whose tracks pointed back when he reversed his shoes all colors made me happy even gray my eyes were such that literally they took photographs whenever i d permit or with a silent shiver order it whatever in my field of vision dwelt an indoor scene hickory leaves the svelte stilettos of a frozen stillicide was printed on my eyelids nether side where it would tarry for an hour or two and while this lasted all i had to do was close my eyes to reproduce the leaves or indoor scene or trophies of the eaves i cannot understand why from the lake i could make out our front porch when i d take lake road to school whilst now although no tree has intervened i look but fail to see even the roof maybe some quirk in space has caused a fold or furrow to displace the fragile vista the frame house between goldsworth and wordsmith on its square of green i had a favorite young shagbark there with ample dark jade leaves and a black spare vermiculated trunk the setting sun bronzed the black bark around which like undone garlands the shadows of the foliage fell it is now stout and rough it has done well white butterflies turn lavender as they pass through its shade where gently seems to sway the phantom of my little daughter s swing the house itself is much the same one wing we ve had revamped there s a solarium there s a picture window flanked with fancy chairs tv s huge paperclip now shines instead of the stiff vane so often visited by the naive the gauzy mockingbird retelling all the programs that she had heard switching from chippo chippo to a clear to wee to wee then rasping out come here come here come herrr flitting her tail aloft or gracefully indulging in a soft upward hop flop and instantly to wee returning to her perch the new tv i was an infant when my parents died they both were ornithologists i ve tried so often to evoke them that today i have a thousand parents sadly they dissolve in their own virtues and recede but certain words chance words i hear or read such as bad heart always to him refer and cancer of the pancreas to her a preterist one who collects cold nests here was my bedroom now reserved for guests here tucked away by the canadian maid i listened to the buzz downstairs and prayed for everybody to be always well uncles and aunts the maid her niece adele who d seen the pope people in books and god i was brought up by dear bizarre aunt maud a poet and a painter with a taste for realistic objects interlaced with grotesque growths and images of doom she lived to hear the next babe cry her room we ve kept intact its trivia create a still life in her style the paperweight of convex glass enclosing a lagoon the verse open at the index moon moonrise moor moral the forlorn guitar the human skull and from the local star a curio red sox beat yanks on chapman s homer thumbtacked to the door my god they died young theolatry i found degrading and its premises unsound no free man needs a god but was i free how fully i felt nature glued to me and how my childish palate loved the taste half fish half honey of that golden paste my picture book was at an early age the painted parchment papering our cage mauve rings around the moon blood orange sun twinned iris and that rare phenomenon the iridule when beautiful and strange in a bright sky above a mountain range one opal cloudlet in an oval form reflects the rainbow of a thunderstorm which in a distant valley has been staged for we are most artistically caged and there s the wall of sound the nightly wall raised by a trillion crickets in the fall impenetrable halfway up the hill i d pause in thrall of their delirious trill that s dr sutton s light that s the great bear a thousand years ago five minutes were equal to forty ounces of fine sand outstare the stars infinite foretime and infinite aftertime above your head they close like giant wings and you are dead the regular vulgarian i daresay is happier he sees the milky way only when making water then as now i walked at my own risk whipped by the bough tripped by the stump asthmatic lame and fat i never bounced a ball or swung a bat i was the shadow of the waxwing slain by feigned remoteness in the windowpane i had a brain five senses one unique but otherwise i was a cloutish freak in sleeping dreams i played with other chaps but really envied nothing save perhaps the miracle of a lemniscate left upon wet sand by nonchalantly deft bicycle tires a thread of subtle pain tugged at by playful death released again but always present ran through me one day when i d just turned eleven as i lay prone on the floor and watched a clockwork toy a tin wheelbarrow and pushed by a tin boy bypass chair legs and stray beneath the bed there was a sudden sunburst in my head and then black night that blackness was sublime i felt distributed through space and time one foot upon a mountaintop one hand under the pebbles of a panting strand one ear in italy one eye in spain in caves my blood and the stars my brain there were dull throbs in my triassic green optical spots in upper pleistocene an icy shiver down my age of stone and all tomorrows in my funny bone during one winter every afternoon i d into that momentary swoon and then it ceased its memory grew dim my health improved i even learned to swim but like some little lad forced by a wench with his pure tongue her abject thirst to quench i was corrupted terrified allured and though old doctor colt pronounced me cured of what he said were mainly growing pains the wonder lingers and the shame remains canto two there was a time in my demented youth when somehow i suspected that the truth about survival after death was known to every human being i alone knew nothing and a great conspiracy of books and people hid the truth from me there was the day when i began to doubt man s sanity how could he live without knowing for sure what dawn what death what doom awaited consciousness beyond the tomb and finally there was the sleepless night when i decided to explore and fight the foul the inadmissible abyss devoting all my twisted life to this one task today i m sixty one waxwings are berry pecking a cicada sings the little scissors i am holding are a dazzling synthesis of sun and star i stand before the window and i pare my fingernails and vaguely am aware of certain flinching likenesses the thumb our grocer s son the index lean and glum college astronomer starover blue the middle fellow a tall priest i knew the feminine fourth finger an old flirt and little pinky clinging to her skirt and i make mouths as i snip off the thin strips of what aunt maud used to call scarf skin maud shade was eighty when a sudden hush fell on her life we saw the angry flush and torsion of paralysis assail her noble cheek we moved her to pinedale famed for its sanitarium there she d sit in the glassed sun and watch the fly that lit upon her dress and then upon her wrist her mind kept fading in the growing mist she still could speak she paused then groped and found what seemed at first a serviceable sound but from adjacent cells impostors took the place of words she needed and her look spelt imploration as she sought in vain to reason with the monsters in her brain what moment in the gradual decay does resurrection choose what year what day who has the stopwatch who rewinds the tape are some less lucky or do all escape a syllogism other men die but i am not another therefore i ll not die space is a swarming in the eyes and time a singing in the ears in this hive i m locked up yet if prior to life we had been able to imagine life what mad impossible unutterably weird wonderful nonsense it might have appeared so why join in the vulgar laughter why scorn a hereafter none can verify the turk s delight the future lyres the talks with socrates and proust in cypress walks the seraph with his six flamingo wings and flemish hells with porcupines and things it isn t that we dream too wild a dream the trouble is we do not make it seem sufficiently unlikely for the most we can think up is a domestic ghost how ludicrous these efforts to translate into one s private tongue a public fate instead of poetry divinely terse disjointed notes insomnia s mean verse life is a message scribbled in the dark anonymous espied on a pine s bark as we were

pauvres cigales meaning that he fed the poor sea gulls lafontaine was wrong dead is the mandible alive the song and so i pare my nails and muse and hear your steps upstairs and all is right my dear sybil throughout our high school days i knew your loveliness but fell in love with you during an outing of the senior class to new wye falls we luncheoned on damp grass our teacher of geology discussed the cataract its roar and rainbow dust made the tame park romantic i reclined in april s haze immediately behind your slender back and watched your neat small head bend to one side one palm with fingers spread between a star of trillium and a stone pressed on the turf a little phalange bone kept twitching then you turned and offered me a thimbleful of bright metallic tea your profile has not changed the glistening teeth biting the careful lip the shade beneath the eyes from the long lashes the peach down rimming the cheekbone the dark silky brown of hair brushed up from temple and from nape the very naked neck the persian shape of nose and eyebrow you have kept it all and on still nights we hear the waterfall come and be worshiped come and be caressed my dark vanessa crimson barred my blest my admirable butterfly explain how could you in the gloam of lilac lane have let uncouth hysterical john shade blubber your face and ear and shoulder blade we have been married forty years at least four thousand times your pillow has been creased by our two heads four hundred thousand times the tall clock with the hoarse westminster chimes has marked our common hour how many more free calendars shall grace the kitchen door i love you when you re standing on the lawn peering at something in a tree it s gone it was so small it might come back all this voiced in a whisper softer than a kiss i love you when you call me to admire a jet s pink trail above the sunset fire i love you when you re humming as you pack a suitcase or the farcical car sack with round trip zipper and i love you most when with a pensive nod you greet her ghost and hold her first toy on your palm or look at a postcard from her found in a book she might have been you me or some quaint blend nature chose me so as to wrench and rend your heart and mine at first we d smile and say all little girls are plump or jim mcvey the family oculist will cure that slight squint in no time and later she ll be quite pretty you know and trying to assuage the swelling torment that s the awkward age she should take riding lessons you would say your eyes and mine not meeting she should play tennis or badminton less starch more fruit she may not be a beauty but she s cute it was no use no use the prizes won in french and history no doubt were fun at christmas parties games were rough no doubt and one shy little guest might be left out but let s be fair while children of her age were cast as elves and fairies on the stage that she d helped paint for the school pantomime my gentle girl appeared as mother time a bent charwoman with a slop pail and broom and like a fool i sobbed in the men s room another winter was scraped scropped away the toothwart white haunted our woods in may summer was power mowed and autumn burned alas the dingy cygnet never turned into a wood duck and again your voice but this is prejudice you should rejoice that she is innocent why overstress the physical she wants to look a mess virgins have written some resplendent books lovemaking is not everything good looks are not that indispensable and still old pan would call from every painted hill and still the demons of our pity spoke no lips would share the lipstick of her smoke the telephone that rang before a ball every two minutes in sorosa hall for her would never ring and with a great screeching of tires on gravel to the gate out of lacquered night a white scarfed beau would never come for her she d never go a dream of gauze and jasmine to that dance we sent her though to a chateau in france and she returned in tears with new defeats new miseries on days when all the streets of college town led to the game she d sit on the library steps and read or knit mostly alone she d be or with that nice frail roommate now a nun and once or twice with a korean boy who took my course she had strange fears strange fantasies strange force of character as when she spent three nights investigating certain sounds and lights in an old barn she twisted words pot top spider redips and powder was red wop she called you a didactic katydid she hardly ever smiled and when she did it was a sign of pain she d criticize ferociously our projects and with eyes expressionless sit on her tumbled bed spreading her swollen feet scratching her head with psoriatic fingernails and moan murmuring dreadful words in monotone she was my darling difficult morose but still my darling you remember those almost unruffled evenings when we played mah jongg or she tried on your furs which made her almost fetching and the mirrors smiled the lights were merciful the shadows mild sometimes i d help her with a latin text or she d be reading in her bedroom next to my fluorescent lair and you would be in your own study twice removed from me and i would hear both voices now and then mother what s grimpen what is what grim pen pause and your guarded scholium then again mother what s chtonic that too you d explain appending would you like a tangerine no yes and what does sempiternal mean you d hesitate and lustily i d roar the answer from my desk through the closed door it does not matter what it was she read some phony modern poem that was said in english lit to be a document engazhay and compelling what this meant nobody cared the point is that the three chambers then bound by you and her and me now form a tryptich or a three act play in which portrayed events forever stay i think she always nursed a small mad hope i d finished recently my book on pope jane dean my typist offered her one day to meet pete dean a cousin jane s fiance would then take all of them in his new car a score of miles to a hawaiian bar the boy was picked up at a quarter past eight in new wye sleet glazed the roads at last they found the place when suddenly pete dean clutching his brow exclaimed that he had clean forgotten an appointment with a chum who d land in jail if he pete did not come et cetera she said she understood after he d gone the three young people stood before the azure entrance for awhile puddles were neon barred and with a smile she said she d be de trop she d much prefer just going home her friends escorted her to the bus stop and left but she instead of riding home got off at lochanhead you scrutinized your wrist it s eight fifteen and here time forked i ll turn it on the screen in its blank broth evolved a lifelike blur and music welled he took one look at her and shot a death ray at well meaning jane a male hand traced from florida to maine the curving arrows of aeolian wars you said that later a quartet of bores two writers and two critics would debate the cause of poetry on channel a nymph came pirouetting under white rotating petals in a vernal rite to kneel before an altar in a wood where various articles of toilet stood i went upstairs and read a galley proof and heard the wind roll marbles on the roof see the blind beggar dance the cripple sing has unmistakably the vulgar ring of its preposterous age then came your call my tender mockingbird up from the hall i was in time to overhear brief fame and have a cup of tea with you my name was mentioned twice as usual just behind one oozy footstep frost sure you don t mind i ll catch the exton plane because you know if i don t come by midnight with the dough and then there was a kind of travelog a host narrator took us through the fog of a march night where headlights from afar approached and grew like a dilating star to the green indigo and tawny sea which we had visited in thirty three nine months before her birth now it was all pepper and salt and hardly could recall that first long ramble the relentless light the flocks of sails one blue among the white clashed queerly with the sea and two were red the man in the old blazer crumbing bread the crowding gulls insufferably loud and one dark pigeon waddling in the crowd was that the phone you listened at the door nothing picked up the program from the floor more headlights in the fog there was no sense in window rubbing only some white fence and the reflector poles passed by unmasked are we quite sure she s acting right you asked it s technically a blind date of course well shall we try the preview of remorse and we allowed in all tranquility the famous film to spread its charmed marquee the famous face flowed in fair and inane the parted lips the swimming eyes the grain of beauty on the cheek odd gallicism and the soft form dissolving in the prism of corporate desire i think she said i ll get off here it s only lochanhead yes that s okay gripping the stang she peered at ghostly trees bus stopped bus disappeared thunder above the jungle no not that pat pink our guest antiatomic chat eleven struck you sighed well i m afraid there s nothing else of interest you played network roulette the dial turned and trk ed commercials were beheaded faces flicked an open mouth in midsong was struck out an imbecile with sideburns was about to use his gun but you were much too quick a jovial negro raised his trumpet trk your ruby ring made life and laid the law oh switch it off and as life snapped we saw a pinhead light dwindle and die in black infinity out of his lakeside shack a watchman father time all gray and bent emerged with his uneasy dog and went along the reedy bank he came too late you gently yawned and stacked away your plate we heard the wind we heard it rush and throw twigs at the windowpane phone ringing no i helped you with the dishes the tall clock kept on demolishing young root old rock midnight you said what s midnight to the young and suddenly a festive blaze was flung across five cedars snowpatches showed and a patrol car on our bumpy road came to a crunching stop retake retake people have thought she tried to cross the lake at lochan neck where zesty skaters crossed from exe to wye on days of special frost others supposed she might have lost her way by turning left from bridgeroad and some say she took her poor young life i know you know it was a night of thaw a night of blow with great excitement in the air black spring stood just around the corner shivering in the wet starlight and on the wet ground the lake lay in the mist its ice half drowned a blurry shape stepped off the reedy bank into a crackling gulping swamp and sank canto three l if lifeless tree your great maybe rabelais the grand potato i p h a lay institute i of preparation p for the hereafter h or if as we called it big if engaged me for one term to speak on death to lecture on the worm wrote president mcaber you and i and she then a mere tot moved from new wye to yewshade in another higher state i love great mountains from the iron gate of the ramshackle house we rented there one saw a snowy form so far so fair that one could only fetch a sigh as if it might assist assimilation iph was a larvorium and a violet a grave in reason s early spring and yet it missed the gist of the whole thing it missed what mostly interests the preterist for we die every day oblivion thrives not on dry thighbones but on blood ripe lives and our best yesterdays are now foul piles of crumpled names phone numbers and foxed files i m ready to become a floweret or a fat fly but never to forget and i ll turn down eternity unless the melancholy and the tenderness of mortal life the passion and the pain the claret taillight of that dwindling plane off hesperus your gesture of dismay on running out of cigarettes the way you smile at dogs the trail of silver slime snails leaves on flagstones this good ink this rhyme this index card this slender rubber band which always forms when dropped an ampersand are found in heaven by the newlydead stored in its strongholds through the years instead the institute assumed it might be wise not to expect too much of paradise what if there s nobody to say hullo to the newcomer no reception no indoctrination what if you are tossed into a boundless world your bearings lost your spirit stripped and utterly alone your task unfinished your despair unknown your body just beginning to putresce a non undressable in morning dress your widow lying prone on a firm bed herself a blur in your dissolving head while snubbing gods including the big g iph borrowed some peripheral debris from mystic visions and it offered tips the amber spectacles for life s eclipse how not to panic when you re made a ghost sidle and slide choose a smooth surd and coast meet solid bodies and glissade right through or let a person circulate through you how to locate in blackness with a gasp terra the fair an orbicle of jasp how to keep sane in spiral types of space precautions to be taken in the case of freak reincarnation what to do on suddenly discovering that you are now a young and vulnerable toad plump in the middle of a busy road or a bear cub beneath a burning pine or a book mite in a revived divine time means succession and succession change hence timelessness is bound to disarrange schedules of sentiment we give advice to widower he has been married twice he meets his wives both loved both loving both jealous of one another time means growth and growth means nothing in elysian life fondling a changeless child the flax haired wife grieves on the brink of a remembered pond full of a dreamy sky and also blond but with a touch of tawny in the shade feet up knees clasped on a stone balustrade the other sits and raises a moist gaze toward the blue impenetrable haze how to begin which first to kiss what toy to give the babe does that small solemn boy know of the head on crash which on a wild march night killed both the mother and the child and she the second love with instep bare in ballerina black why does she wear the earrings from the other s jewel case and why does she avert her fierce young face for as we know from dreams it is so hard to speak to our dear dead they disregard our apprehension queaziness and shame the awful sense that they re not quite the same and our school chum killed in a distant war is not surprised to see us at his door and in a blend of jauntiness and gloom points at the puddles in his basement room but who can teach the thoughts we should roll call when morning finds us marching to the wall under the stage direction of some goon political some uniformed baboon we ll think of matters only known to us empires of rhyme indies of calculus listen to the distant cocks crow and discern upon the rough gray wall a rare wall fern and while our royal hands are being tied taunt our inferiors cheerfully deride the dedicated imbeciles and spit into their eyes just for the fun of it nor can one help the exile the old man dying in a motel with the loud fan revolving in the torrid prairie night and from the outside bits of colored light reaching his bed like dark hands from the past offering gems and death is coming fast he suffocates and conjures in two tongues the nebulae dilating in his lungs a wrench a rift that s all one can foresee maybe one finds le grand neant maybe again one spirals from the tuber s eye as you remarked the last time we went by the institute i really could not tell the difference between this place and hell we heard cremationists guffaw and snort at grabermann s denouncing the retort as detrimental to the birth of wraiths we all avoided criticizing faiths the great starover blue reviewed the role planets had played as landfalls of the soul the fate of beasts was pondered a chinese discanted on the etiquette at teas with ancestors and how far up to go i tore apart the fantasies of poe and dealt with childhood memories of strange nacreous gleams beyond the adults range among our auditors were a young priest and an old communist iph could at least compete with churches and the party line in later years it started to decline buddhism took root a medium smuggled in pale jellies and a floating mandolin fra karamazov mumbling his inept all is allowed into some classes crept and to fulfill the fish wish of the womb a school of freudians headed for the tomb that tasteless venture helped me in a way i learnt what to ignore in my survey of death s abyss and when we lost our child i knew there would be nothing no self styled spirit would touch a keyboard of dry wood to rap out her pet name no phantom would rise gracefully to welcome you and me in the dark garden near the shagbark tree what is that funny creaking do you hear it is the shutter on the stairs my dear if you re not sleeping let s turn on the light i hate that wind let s play some chess all right i m sure it s not the shutter there again it is a tendril fingering the pane what glided down the roof and made that thud it is old winter tumbling in the mud and now what shall i do my knight is pinned who rides so late in the night and the wind it is the writer s grief it is the wild march wind it is the father with his child later came minutes hours whole days at last when she d be absent from our thoughts so fast did life the wooly caterpillar run we went to italy sprawled in the sun on a white beach with other pink or brown americans flew back to our small town found that my bunch of essay the untamed seahorse was universally accalimed it sold three hundred copies in one year again school started and on hillsides where wound distant roads one saw the steady stream of carlights all returning to the dream of college education you went on translating into french marvell and donne it was a year of tempests hurricane lolita swept from florida to maine mars glowed shahs married gloomy russians spied lang made your portrait and one night i died the crashaw club had paid me to discuss why poetry is meaningful to us i gave my sermon a full thing but short as i was leaving in some haste to thwart the so called question period at the end one of those peevish people who attend such talks only to say they disagree stood up and pointed his pipe at me and then it happened the attack the trance or one of my old fits there sat by chance a doctor in the front row at his feet patly i fell my heart had stopped to beat it seems and several moments passed before it heaved and went on trudging to a more conclusive destination give me now your full attention i can t tell you how i knew but i did know that i had crossed the border everything i loved was lost but no aorta could report regret a sun of rubber was convulsed and set and blood black nothingness began to spin a system of cells interlinked within cells interlinked within cells interlinked within one stem and dreadfully distinct against the dark a tall white fountain played i realized of course that it was made not of our atoms that the sense behind the scene was not our sense in life the mind of any man is quick to recognize natural shams and then before his eyes the reed becomes a bird the knobby twig an inchworm and the cobra head a big wickedly folded moth but in the case of my white fountain what it did replace perceptually was something that i felt could be grasped only by whoever dwelt in the strange world where i was a mere stray and presently i saw it melt away though still unconscious i was back on earth the tale i told provoked my doctor s mirth he doubted very much that in the state he found me in one could hallucinate or dream in any sense later perhaps but not during the actual collapse no mr shade but doctor i was dead he smiled not quite just half a shade he said however i demurred in mind i kept replaying the whole thing again i stepped down from the platform and felt strange and hot and saw the chap stand up and toppled not because a heckler pointed with his pipe but probably because the time was ripe for just that bump and wobble on the part of a limp blimp an old unstable heart my vision reeked with truth it had the tone the quiddity and quaintness of its own reality it was as time went on its constant vertical in triumph shone often when troubled by the outer flare of street and strife inward i d turn and there there in the background of my soul it stood old faithful and its presence always would console me wonderfully then one day i came across what seemed a twin display it was a story in a magazine about a mrs z whose heart had been rubbed back to life by a prompt surgeon s hand she told her interviewer of the land beyond the veil and the account contained a hint of angels and a glint of stained windows and some soft music and a choice of hymnal items and her mother s voice but at the end she mentioned a remote landscape a hazy orchard and i quote beyond that orchard through a kind of smoke i glimpsed a tall white fountain and awoke if on some nameless island captain schmidt sees a new animal and captures it and if a little later captain smith brings back a skin that island is no myth our fountain was a signpost and a mark objectively enduring in the dark strong as a bone substantial as a tooth and almost vulgar in its robust truth the article was by jim coates to jim forthwith i wrote got her address from him drove west three hundred miles to talk to her arrived was met by an impassioned purr saw that blue hair those freckled hands that rapt orchideous air and knew that i was trapped who d miss an opportunity to meet a poet so distinguished i was sweet of me to come i desperately tried to ask my questions they were brushed aside perhaps some other time the journalist still had her scribblings i should not insist she plied me with fruit cake turning it all into an idiotic social call i can t believe she said that it is you i loved your poem in the blue review that one about mont blanc i have a niece who s climbed the matternhorn the other piece i could not understand i mean the sense because of course the sound but i m so dense she was i might have persevered i might have made her tell me more about the white fountain we both had seen beyond the veil but if i thought i mentioned that detail she d pounce upon it as upon a fond affinity a sacramental bond uniting mystically her and me and in a jiffy our two souls would be brother and sister trembling on the brink of tender incest well i said i think it s getting late i also called on coates he was afraid he had mislaid her notes he took his article from a steel file it s accurate i have not changed her style there s one misprint not that it matters much mountain not fountain the majestic touch life everlasting based on a misprint i mused as i drove homeward take the hint and stop investigating my abyss but all at once it dawned on me that this was the real point the contrapuntal theme just this not text but texture not the dream but topsy turvical coincidence not flimsy nonsense but a web of sense yes it sufficed that i in life could find some kind of link and bobolink some kind or correlated pattern in the game plexed artistry and something of the same ,"['page', 'uneasy', 'auditor', 'blimp',

gods so tell a men they gon have to carry a amen now make amends wit god boy i thought you was gonna be one of the best the up and comers one of the best for sure and then i seen it there s no content when i dissect ya bars there s no substance joe buddens y all get it we all see he ain t complex no more so like i said i appreciate you reachin out but wait til round three cause there s some shit we gotta speak about round a ward i said it s apparent that you very thirsty go ahead and drink some more of that water you think i m supposed to believe that you got guns over the boarder when unfortunately we couldn t even gunn over the boarder third round is supposed to be the closer right well this where it gets so gritty my brother kannon told me always stay strapped up if you ain t walkin around in ya own city i said whoa man charron scam they checkin heat at the door there s no blickeys and i don t do gun bars then realized for the first time ever i got a shotti and a krome wit me that shotti is from mile where bodies drop they love triggers after the slug hit ya you lose and i leave wit the shotti p dub nigga a ward that chrome krome a magnum good from a long shot i got it from aye bro where you from again krome montreal a ward montre i bought the chrome krome at a pawn shop it s registered in my name the serial number good no trail or prints and like you half the time it stay in the vault but this head shot outta self defense look you made the boy wonder why you wanted this free smoke two rounds i done heard god in ya angles but what about guardian angels cause you gon need both you told b dot you can t eat books for dinner played the street card like some cool guy wool eyes that mask got mascot you consumed like school pride tell me if that s the case then why is it the hunger i had in the classroom made sure that i had full ride now i eat off that and i eat off rap i got it from the mud my mother had dinner for five kids to fix life wasn t sweet mental illness had her pullin pills out and my father s breath always smelled liquor ish the difference is i don t say all that to act better cort and the reason i got faith in god can t just be explained in a battle rap metaphor i got the same questions as him often times i look up at heaven puzzled and defeated i ma be honest wit you sometimes when i say god is good on the inside even i struggle to believe it it s transparency authenticity it matters to the fans you keep a drum i keep it a stack lets have a battle of the bands you on the king s turf facin cort on this soil i make him eat dirt i m the underdog i duck a swing first the right up front the left behind i m bout to leave earth flee hurt his fee just took a hit that s a cheap verse real reel lines put the kid in the sky that how a dreamworks i m outta character i need church like a weeks worth my head not in the right place it s like a breached birth i left the pen lookin for murder they freed surf i wanna tell you somethin a ward draw a nah palindrome reverse i just get him cracked then send him back to smack wrapped in his al kapone t shirt i m nice i ain t come to get personal wit you but i brought enough bars to body you and anybody person that s with you so tell em fall in line and until then god is good all the time round cortez that third round was cute it really wasn t nothin to stress the irony you jump in for him but last battle you wasn t even gon jump in for quest now like i said i appreciate y all reachin out but this is round three and there s some shit we gotta speak about a ward is with a group called ytg combined the group can t even crack him a million nuborn peaked then still couldn t crack through the ceilin bonnie got put on front street versus ness lee cause apparently she stealin and what did you do did you hold down ya clique huh did you hold em down or did you switch to avoid em did he whine wine or break bread i m tryin to figure out what the ministry taught him i mean you left em flat it turned ya back and then you switched to the horsemen so you re peter the apostle you denied ya bros got low once you heard that that chicken was callin hold on wait one second now it s the horsemen he s wit huh let me guess street hymns is arn anderson i mean i know who gives a fuck plus he s never been an enforcer in the streets they hem him up he doesn t even sell tickets his image is off he s finished and washed the fans don t give a shit anymore so he is arn anderson why cause he never sold out and every time he s in the ring it s the littlest draws drawers let me guess who else who else is in the clique saga saga right saga he s gotta be curt hennig always smackin his gums thinkin his rap s perfect nah he s curt hennig cause he needs to throw in the towel he dead on this rap circuit he let smack down they don t think that this match worth it but then he got mad fuckin hypocrite talkin bout smack jerked him nah nah nah and let me talk about loso nah nah i ain t gon lie that boy is hot but if y all tellin me loso is ric flair whoo that s where the bullshit gotta stop cause he s more like brett hitman hart not cause he s a sharp shooter wit the shot he s brett hart cause every move he learnt in the ring he learnt it from his pops and then there s you all the potential all the essentials ya vision was clear then you left ytg and started dissin ya peers breakin ya neck for a chance to start snappin and even cripplin careers i mean wait a minute you ain t a savage threat you re average best left ytg and had me vexed all this for a chance to rep so you are chris benoit you willin to kill off ya own fam just for a chance to snappin next necks team ganik for the win i had pressure to beat him but when you use christianity as ya crutch boy that s a lesson for heathens cause you re a god fearing man right well that blessin is misleadin chris benoit another dead man who couldn t wrestle his demons i got a new slogan bitch fuck you fakes corny y all keep doin what ya do but stay the fuck away from me it s brooklyn all day i keep it trill for that toronto lick a shot for ph the realness is back embed,"['threat', 'dog', 'drop', 'versus', 'innovative', 'fan',

shaftoe can do on short notice he s standing on the running board gripping his springfield with one hand and the rearview mirror with the other so counting the syllables on his fingers is out of the question is tires one syllable or two how about wail the truck finally makes up its mind not to tip over and thuds back onto four wheels the wail and the moment are lost bobby can still hear the coolies singing though and now too there s the gunlike snicking of the truck s clutch linkage as private wiley downshifts could wiley be losing his nerve and in the back under the tarps a ton and a half of file cabinets clanking code books slaloming fuel spanking the tanks of station alpha s electrical generator the modern world s hell on haiku writers electrical generator is what eight syllables you couldn t even fit that onto the second line are we allowed to run over people private wiley inquires and then mashes the horn button before bobby shaftoe can answer a sikh policeman hurdles a night soil cart shaftoe s gut reaction is sure what re they going to do declare war on us but as the highest ranking man on this truck he s probably supposed to be using his head or something so he doesn t blurt it out just yet he takes stock of the situation shanghai hours friday the th of november bobby shaftoe and the other half dozen marines on his truck are staring down the length of kiukiang road onto which they ve just made this careening high speed turn cathedral s going by to the right so that means they are what two blocks away from the bund a yangtze river patrol gunboat is tied up there waiting for the stuff they ve got in the back of this truck the only real problem is that those particular two blocks are inhabited by about five million chinese people now these chinese are sophisticated urbanites not suntanned yokels who ve never seen cars before they ll get out of your way if you drive fast and honk your horn and indeed many of them flee to one side of the street or the other producing the illusion that the truck its moving faster than the forty three miles an hour shown on its speedometer but the bamboo grove in bobby shaftoe s haiku has not been added just to put a little oriental flavor into the poem and wow the folks back home in oconomowoc there is a lot of heavy bamboo in front of this truck dozens of makeshift turnpikes blocking their path to the river for the officers of the u s navy s asiatic fleet and of the fourth marines who dreamed up this little operation forgot to take the friday afternoon factor into account as bobby shaftoe could ve explained to them if only they d bothered to ask a poor dumb jarhead their route took them through the heart of the banking district here you ve got the hong kong and shanghai bank of course city bank chase manhattan the bank of america and bbme and the agricultural bank of china and any number of crappy little provincial banks and several of those banks have contracts with what s left of the chinese government to print currency it must be a cutthroat business because they slash costs by printing it on old newspapers and if you know how to read chinese you can see last year s news stories and polo scores peeking through the colored numbers and pictures that transform these pieces of paper into legal tender as every chicken peddler and rickshaw operator in shanghai knows the money printing contracts stipulate that all of the bills these banks print have to be backed by such and such an amount of silver i e anyone should be able to walk into one of those banks at the end of kiukiang road and slap down a pile of bills and provided that those bills were printed by that same bank receive actual metallic silver in exchange now if china weren t right in the middle of getting systematically drawn and quartered by the empire of nippon it would probably send official bean counters around to keep tabs on how much silver was actually present in these banks vaults and it would all be quiet and orderly but as it stands the only thing keeping these banks honest is the other banks here s how they do it during the normal course of business lots of paper money will pass over the counters of say chase manhattan bank they ll take it into a back room and sort it throwing into money boxes a couple of feet square and a yard deep with ropes on the four corners all of the bills that were printed by say bank of america in one all of the city bank bills into another then on friday afternoon they will bring in coolies each coolie or pair of coolies will of course have his great big long bamboo pole with him a coolie without his pole is like a china marine without his nickel plated bayonet and will poke their pole through the ropes on the corners of the box then one coolie will get underneath each end of the pole hoisting the box into the air they have to move in unison or else the box begins flailing around and everything gets out of whack so as they head towards their destination whatever bank whose name is printed on the bills in their box they sing to each other and plant their feet on the pavement in time to the music the pole s pretty long so they are that far apart and they have to sing loud to hear each other and of course each pair of coolies in the street is singing their own particular song trying to drown out all of the others so that they don t get out of step so ten minutes before closing time on friday afternoon the doors of many banks burst open and numerous pairs of coolies march in singing like the curtain raiser on a fucking broadway musical slam their huge boxes of tattered currency down and demand silver in exchange all of the banks do this to each other sometimes they ll all do it on the same friday particularly at times like november when even a grunt like bobby shaftoe can understand that it s better to be holding silver than piles of old cut up newspaper and that is why once the normal pedestrians and food cart operators and furious sikh cops have scurried out of the way and plastered themselves up against the clubs and shops and bordellos on kiukiang road bobby shaftoe and the other marines on the truck still cannot even see the gunboat that is their destination because of this horizontal forest of mighty bamboo poles they cannot even hear the honking of their own truck horn because of the wild throbbing pentatonic cacophony of coolies singing this ain t just your regular friday p m shanghai bank district money rush this is an ultimate settling of accounts before the whole eastern hemisphere catches fire the millions of promises printed on those slips of bumwad will all be kept or broken in the next ten minutes actual pieces of silver and gold will move or they won t it is some kind of fiduciary judgment day jesus christ i can t private wiley hollers the captain said don t stop for any reason whatsofuckinever shaftoe reminds him he s not telling wiley to run over the coolies he s reminding wiley that if he refrains from running over them they will have some explaining to do which will be complicated by the fact that the captain s right behind them in a car stuffed with tommy gun toting china marines and from the way the captain s been acting about this station alpha thing it s pretty clear that he already has a few preliminary strap marks on his ass courtesy of some admiral in pearl harbor or even drumroll marine barracks eight and eye streets southeast washington d c shaftoe and the other marines have always known station alpha as a mysterious claque of pencil necked swabbies who hung out on the roof of a building in the international settlement in a shack of knot pocked cargo pallet planks with antennas sticking out of it every which way if you stood there long enough you could see some of those antennas moving zeroing in on something out to sea shaftoe even wrote a haiku about it antenna searches retriever s nose in the wind ether s far secrets this was only his second haiku ever clearly not up to november standards and he cringes to remember it but in no way did any of the marines comprehend what a big deal station alpha was until today their job had turned out to involve wrapping a ton of equipment and several tons of paper in tarps and moving it out of doors then they spent thursday tearing the shack apart making it into a bonfire and burning certain books and papers sheeeyit private wiley hollers only a few of the coolies have gotten out of the way or even seen them but then there is this fantastic boom from the river like the sound of a mile thick bamboo pole being snapped over god s knee half a second later there re no coolies in the street anymore just a lot of boxes with unmanned bamboo poles teeter tottering on them bonging into the streets like wind chimes above a furry mushroom of grey smoke rises from the gunboat wiley shifts up to high gear and floors it shaftoe cringes against the truck s door and lowers his head hoping that his campy great war doughboy helmet will be good for something then money boxes start to rupture and explode as the truck rams through them shaftoe peers up through a blizzard of notes and sees giant bamboo poles soaring and bounding and windmilling toward the waterfront the leaves of shanghai pale doorways in a steel sky winter has begun barrens let s set the existence of god issue aside for a later volume and just stipulate that in some way self replicating organisms came into existence on this planet and immediately began trying to get rid of each other either by spamming their environments with rough copies of themselves or by more direct means which hardly need to be belabored most of them failed and their genetic legacy was erased from the universe forever but a few found some way to survive and to propagate after about three billion years of this sometimes zany frequently tedious fugue of carnality and carnage godfrey waterhouse iv was born in murdo south dakota to blanche the wife of a congregational preacher named bunyan waterhouse like every other creature on the face of the earth godfrey was by birthright a stupendous badass albeit in the somewhat narrow technical sense that he could trace his ancestry back up a long line of slightly less highly evolved stupendous badasses to that first self replicating gizmo which given the number and variety of its descendants might justifiably be described as the most stupendous badass of all time everyone and everything that wasn t a stupendous badass was dead as nightmarishly lethal memetically programmed death machines went these were the nicest you could ever hope to meet in the tradition of his namesake the puritan writer john bunyan who spent much of his life in jail or trying to avoid it the rev waterhouse did not preach in any one place for long the church moved him from one small town in the dakotas to another every year or two it is possible that godfrey found the lifestyle more than a little alienating for sometime during the course of his studies at fargo congregational college he bolted from the fold and to the enduring agony of his parents fell into worldy pursuits and ended up somehow getting a ph d in classics from a small private university in ohio academics being no less nomadic than congregational preachers he took work where he could find it he became a professor of greek and latin at bolger christian college enrollment in west point virginia where the mattaponi and pamunkey rivers came together to form the estuarial james and the loathsome fumes of the big paper mill permeated every drawer every closet even the interior pages of books godfrey s young bride nee alice pritchard who had grown up following her itinerant preacher father across the vastnesses of eastern montana where air smelt of snow and sage threw up for three months six months later she gave birth to lawrence pritchard waterhouse the boy had a peculiar relationship with sound when a fire engine passed he was not troubled by the siren s howl or the bell s clang but when a hornet got into the house and swung across the ceiling in a broad lissajous droning almost inaudibly he cried in pain at the noise and if he saw or smelled something that scared him he would clap his hands over his ears one noise that troubled him not at all was the pipe organ in the chapel at bolger christian college the chapel itself was nothing worth mentioning but the organ had been endowed by the paper mill family and would have sufficed for a church four times the size it nicely complemented the organist a retired high school math teacher who felt that certain attributes of the lord violence and capriciousness in the old testament majesty and triumph in the new could be directly conveyed into the souls of the enpewed sinners through a kind of frontal sonic impregnation that he ran the risk of blowing out the stained glass windows was of no consequence since no one liked them anyway and the paper mill fumes were gnawing at the interstitial lead but after one little old lady too many staggered down the aisle after a service reeling from tinnitus and made a barbed comment to the minister about the exceedingly dramatic music the organist was replaced nevertheless he continued to give lessons on the instrument students were not allowed to touch the organ until they were proficient at the piano and when this was explained to lawrence pritchard waterhouse he taught himself in three weeks how to play a bach fugue and signed up for organ lessons since he was only five years old at the time he was unable to reach both the manuals and the pedals and had to play standing or rather strolling from pedal to pedal when lawrence was twelve the organ broke down that paper mill family had not left any endowment for maintenance so the math teacher decided to have a crack at it he was in poor health and required a nimble assistant lawrence who helped him open up the hood of the thing for the first time in all those years the boy saw what had been happening when he had been pressing those keys for each stop each timbre or type of sound that the organ could make viz blockflote trumpet piccolo there was a separate row of pipes arranged in a line from long to short long pipes made low notes short high the tops of the pipes defined a graph not a straight line but an upward tending curve the organist math teacher sat down with a few loose pipes a pencil and paper and helped lawrence figure out why when lawrence understood it was as if the math teacher had suddenly played the good part of bach s fantasia and fugue in g minor on a pipe organ the size of the spiral nebula in andromeda the part where uncle johann dissects the architecture of the universe in one merciless descending ever mutating chord as if his foot is thrusting through skidding layers of garbage until it finally strikes bedrock in particular the final steps of the organist s explanation were like a falcon s dive through layer after layer of pretense and illusion thrilling or sickening or confusing depending on what you were the heavens were riven open lawrence glimpsed choirs of angels ranking off into geometrical infinity the pipes sprouted in parallel ranks from a broad flat box of compressed air all of the pipes for a given note but belonging to different stops lined up with each other along one axis all of the pipes for a given stop but tuned at different pitches lined up with each other along the other perpendicular axis down there in the flat box of air then was a mechanism that got air to the right pipes at the right times when a key or pedal was depressed all of the pipes capable of sounding the corresponding note would speak as long as their stops were pulled out mechanically all of this was handled in a fashion that was perfectly clear simple and logical lawrence had supposed that the machine must be at least as complicated as the most intricate fugue that could be played on it now he had learned that a machine simple in its design could produce results of infinite complexity stops were rarely used alone they tended to be piled on top of each other in combinations that were designed to take advantage of the available harmonics more tasty mathematics here certain combinations in particular were used over and over again lots of blockflo autes in varying lengths for the quiet offertory for example the organ included an ingenious mechanism called the preset which enabled the organist to select a particular combination of stops stops he himself had chosen instantly he would punch a button and several stops would bolt out from the console driven by pneumatic pressure and in that instant the organ would become a different instrument with entirely new timbres the next summer both lawrence and alice his mother were colonized by a distant cousin a stupendous badass of a virus lawrence escaped from it with an almost imperceptible tendency to drag one of his feet alice wound up in an iron lung later unable to cough effectively she got pneumonia and died lawrence s father godfrey freely confessed that he was not equal to the burdens now laid on his shoulders he resigned from his position at the small college in virginia and moved with his son to a small house in moorhead minnesota next door to where bunyan and blanche had settled later he got a job teaching at a nearby normal school at this point all of the responsible adults in lawrence s life seemed to arrive at a tacit agreement that the best way to raise him certainly the easiest was to leave him alone on the rare occasions when lawrence requested adult intervention in his life he was usually asking questions that no one could answer at the age of sixteen having found nothing in the local school system to challenge him lawrence pritchard waterhouse went off to college he matriculated at iowa state college which among other things was the site of a naval rotc installation in which he was forcibly enrolled the iowa state naval rotc had a band and was delighted to hear that lawrence had an interest in music since it was hard to drill on the deck of a dreadnought while playing a pipe organ they issued him a glockenspiel and a couple of little dingers when not marching back and forth on the flood plain of the skunk river making loud dinging noises lawrence was majoring in mechanical engineering he ended up doing poorly in this area because he had fallen in with a bulgarian professor named john vincent atanasoff and his graduate student clifford berry who were building a machine that was intended to automate the solution of some especially tedious differential equations the basic problem for lawrence was that he was lazy he had figured out that everything was much simpler if like superman with his x ray vision you just stared through the cosmetic distractions and saw the underlying mathematical skeleton once you found the math in a thing you knew everything about it and you could manipulate it to your heart s content with nothing more than a pencil and a napkin he saw it in the curve of the silver bars on his glockenspiel saw it in the catenary arch of a bridge and in the capacitor studded drum of atanasoff and berry s computing machine actually pounding on the glockenspiel riveting the bridge together or trying to figure out why the computing machine wasn t working were not as interesting to him consequently he got poor grades from time to time though he would perform some stunt on the blackboard that would leave his professor weak in the knees and the other students baffled and hostile word got around at the same time his grandmother blanche was invoking her extensive congregational connections working the angles on lawrence s behalf totally unbeknownst to him her efforts culminated in triumph when lawrence was awarded an obscure scholarship endowed by a st paul oat processing heir whose purpose was to send midwestern congregationalists to the ivy league for one year which evidently was deemed a long enough period of time to raise their iqs by a few crucial points but not long enough to debauch them so lawrence got to be a sophomore in princeton now princeton was an august school and going there was a great honor but no one got around to mentioning either of these facts to lawrence who had no way of knowing this had bad and good consequences he accepted the scholarship with a faintness of gratitude that infuriated the oat lord on the other hand he adjusted to princeton easily because it was just another place it reminded him of the nicer bits of virginia and there were some nice pipe organs in town though he was not all that happy with his engineering homework of bridge designing and sprocket cutting problems as always these eventually came down to math most of which he could handle easily from time to time he would get stuck though which led him to the fine hall the headquarters of the math department there was a motley assortment of fellows wandering around in fine hall many sporting british or european accents administratively speaking many of these fellows were not members of the math department at all but a separate thing called ias which stood for institute for advanced something or other but they were all in the same building and they all knew a thing or two about math so the distinction didn t exist for lawrence quite a few of these men would pretend shyness when lawrence sought their advice but others were at least willing to hear him out for example he had come up with a way to solve a difficult sprocket tooth shape problem that as normally solved by engineers would require any number of perfectly reasonable but aesthetically displeasing approximations lawrence s solution would provide exact results the only drawback was that it would require a quintillion slide rule operators a quintillion years to solve lawrence was working on a radically different approach that if it worked would bring those figures down to a trillion and a trillion respectively unfortunately lawrence was unable to interest anyone at fine hall in anything as prosaic as gears until all of a sudden he made friends with an energetic british fellow whose name he promptly forgot but who had been doing a lot of literal sprocket making himself lately this fellow was trying to build of all things a mechanical calculating machine specifically a machine to calculate certain values of the riemann zeta function certain values of the riemann zeta function equation cannot be rendered in text where s is a complex number lawrence found this zeta function to be no more and no less interesting than any other math problem until his new friend assured him that it was frightfully important and that some of the best mathematicians in the world had been gnawing on it for decades the two of them ended up staying awake until three in the morning working out the solution to lawrence s sprocket problem lawrence presented the results proudly to his engineering professor who snidely rejected it on grounds of practicality and gave him a poor grade for his troubles lawrence finally remembered after several more contacts that the name of the friendly brit was al something or other because al was a passionate cyclist he and al went on quite a few bicycle rides through the countryside of the garden state as they rode around new jersey they talked about math and particularly about machines for taking the dull part of math off their hands but al had been thinking about this subject for longer than lawrence and had figured out that computing machines were much more than just labor saving devices he d been working on a radically different sort of computing mechanism that would work out any arithmetic problem whatsoever as long as you knew how to write the problem down from a pure logic standpoint he had already figured out everything there was to know about this as yet hypothetical machine though he had yet to build one lawrence gathered that actually building machinery was looked on as undignified at cambridge england that is where this al character was based or for that matter at fine hall al was thrilled to have found in lawrence someone who did not share this view al delicately asked him one day if lawrence would terribly mind calling him by his full and proper name which was alan and not al lawrence apologized and said he would try very hard to keep it in mind one day a couple of weeks later as the two of them sat by a running stream in the woods above the delaware water gap alan made some kind of an outlandish proposal to lawrence involving penises it required a great deal of methodical explanation which alan delivered with lots of blushing and stuttering he was ever so polite and several times emphasized that he was acutely aware that not everyone in the world was interested in this sort of thing lawrence decided that he was probably one of those people alan seemed vastly impressed that lawrence had paused to think about it at all and apologized for putting him out they went directly back to a discussion of computing machines and their friendship continued unchanged but on their next bicycle ride an overnight camping trip to the pine barrens they were joined by a new fellow a german named rudy von something or other alan and rudy s relationship seemed closer or at least more multilayered than alan and lawrence s lawrence concluded that alan s penis scheme must have finally found a taker it got lawrence to thinking from an evolution standpoint what was the point of having people around who were not inclined to have offspring there must be some good and fairly subtle reason for it the only thing he could work out was that it was groups of people societies rather than individual creatures who were now trying to out reproduce and or kill each other and that in a society there was plenty of room for someone who didn t have kids as long as he was up to something useful alan and rudy and lawrence rode south anyway looking for the pine barrens after a while the towns became very far apart and the horse farms gave way to a low stubble of feeble spiny trees that appeared to extend all the way to florida blocking their view but not the headwind where are the pine barrens i wonder lawrence asked a couple of times he even stopped at a gas station to ask someone that question his companions began to make fun of him vere are ze pine barrens rudy inquired looking about quizzically i should look for something rather barren looking with numerous pine trees alan mused there was no other traffic and so they had spread out across the road to pedal three abreast with alan in the middle a forest as kafka would imagine it rudy muttered by this point lawrence had figured out that they were in fact in the pine barrens but he didn t know who kafka was a mathematician he guessed zat is a scary sing to sink of rudy said he is a writer alan said lawrence please don t be offended that i ask you this but do you recognize any other people s names at all other than family and close friends i mean lawrence must have looked baffled i m trying to figure out whether it all comes from in here alan said reaching out to rap his knuckles on the side of lawrence s head or do you sometimes take in new ideas from other human beings when i was a little boy i saw angels in a church in virginia lawrence said but i think that they came from inside my head very well alan said but later alan had another go at it they had reached the fire lookout tower and it had been a thunderous disappointment just an alienated staircase leading nowhere and a small cleared area below that was glittery with shards of liquor bottles they pitched their tent by the side of a pond that turned out to be full of rust colored algae that stuck to the hairs on their bodies then there was nothing left to do but drink schnapps and talk about math alan said look it s like this bertrand russell and another chap named whitehead wrote principia mathematica now i know you re pulling my leg waterhouse said even i know that sir isaac newton wrote that newton wrote a different book also called principia mathematica which isn t really about mathematics at all it s about what we would today call physics then why did he call it principia mathematica because the distinction between mathematics and physics wasn t especially clear in newton s day or maybe even in zis day rudy said which is directly relevant to what i m talking about alan continued i am talking about russell s p m in which he and whitehead started absolutely from scratch i mean from nothing and built it all up all mathematics from a small number of first principles and why i am telling you this lawrence is that lawrence pay attention hmmm rudy take this stick here that s right and keep a close eye on lawrence and when he gets that foggy look on his face poke him with it zis is not an english school you can t do zese kind of sing i m listening lawrence said what came out of p m which was terrifically radical was the ability to say that all of math really can be expressed as a certain ordering of symbols leibniz said it a long time before zen protested rudy er leibniz invented the notation we use for calculus but i m not talking about zat and he invented matrices but i m not talking about zat eezer and he did some work with binary arithmetic but zat is completely different well what the hell are you talking about then rudy leibniz invented ze basic alphabet wrote down a set of symbols for expressing statements about logic well i wasn t aware that herr leibniz counted formal logic among his interests but of course he wanted to do what russell and whitehead did except not just with mathematics but with everything in ze whole world well from the fact that you are the only man on the planet rudy who seems to know about this undertaking of leibniz s can we assume that he failed you can assume anything that pleases your fancy alan rudy responded but i am a mathematician and i do not assume anything alan sighed woundedly and gave rudy a significant look which waterhouse assumed meant that there would be trouble later if i may just make some headway here he said all i m really trying to get you to agree on is that mathematics can be expressed as a series of symbols he snatched the lawrence poking stick and began drawing things like the dirt and frankly i could not care less whether they happen to be leibniz s symbols or russell s or the hexagrams of the i ching leibniz was fascinated by the i ching rudy began shut up about leibniz for a moment rudy because look here you rudy and i are on a train as it were sitting in the dining car having a nice conversation and that train is being pulled along at a terrific clip by certain locomotives named the bertrand russell and riemann and euler and others and our friend lawrence is running alongside the train trying to keep up with us it s not that we re smarter than he is necessarily but that he s a farmer who didn t get a ticket and i rudy am simply reaching out through the open window here trying to pull him onto the fucking train with us so that the three of us can have a nice little chat about mathematics without having to listen to him panting and gasping for breath the whole way all right alan won t take a minute if you will just stop interrupting but there is a locomotive too named leibniz is it that you don t think i give enough credit to germans because i am about to mention a fellow with an umlaut oh would it be herr turing rudy said slyly herr turing comes later i was actually thinking of godel but he s not german he s austrian i m afraid that it s all the same now isn t it ze anschluss wasn t my idea you don t have to look at me that way i think hitler is appalling i ve heard of godel waterhouse put in helpfully but could we back up just a sec of course lawrence why bother why did russell do it was there something wrong with math i mean two plus two equals four right alan picked up two bottlecaps and set them down on the ground two one two plus he set down two more another two one two equals four one two three four what s so bad about that lawrence said but lawrence when you really do math in an abstract way you re not counting bottlecaps are you i m not counting anything rudy broke the following news zat is a very modern position for you to take it is alan said there was this implicit belief for a long time that math was a sort of physics of bottlecaps that any mathematical operation you could do on paper no matter how complicated could be reduced in theory anyway to messing about with actual physical counters such as bottlecaps in the real world but you can t ha,"['page', 'wail', 'spend', 'knot', 'secret', 'grey', 'hoist', 'tradition', 'helpfully', 'grandmother',

bassorah fn there was once of days of yore and in ages and times long gone before a merchant who dwelt in the land of bassorah and who owned two sons and wealth galore but in due time allah the all hearing the all knowing decreed that he should be admitted to the mercy of the most high so he died and his two sons laid him out and buried him after which they divided his gardens and estates equally between them and of his portion each one opened a shop fn presently the elder son hasan hight a youth of passing beauty and loveliness symmetry and perfect grace betook himself to the company of lewd folk women and low boys frolicking with them in gardens and feasting them with meat and wine for months together and occupying himself not with his business like as his father had done for that he exulted in the abundance of his good after some time he had wasted all his ready money so he sold all his father s lands and houses and played the wastrel until there remained in his hand nothing neither little nor muchel nor was one of his comrades left who knew him he abode thus anhungred he and his widowed mother three days and on the fourth day as he walked along unknowing whither to wend there met him a man of his father s friends who questioned him of his case he told him what had befallen him and the other said o my son i have a brother who is a goldsmith an thou wilt thou shalt be with him and learn his craft and become skilled therein hasan consented and accompanied him to his brother to whom he commended him saying in very sooth this is my son do thou teach him for my sake so hasan abode with the goldsmith and busied himself with the craft and allah opened to him the door of gain and in due course he set up shop for himself one day as he sat in his booth in the bazar there came up to him an ajam a foreigner a persian with a great white beard and a white turband fn on his head having the semblance of a merchant who after saluting him looked at his handiwork and examined it knowingly it pleased him and he shook his head saying by allah thou art a cunning goldsmith what may be thy name hasan replied the other shortly fn the persian continued to look at his wares whilst hasan read in an old book fn he hent in hand and the folk were taken up with his beauty and loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace till the hour of midafternoon prayer when the shop became clear of people and the persian accosted the young man saying o my son thou art a comely youth what book is that thou hast no sire and i have no son and i know an art than which there is no goodlier in the world and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say when it was the seven hundred and seventy ninth night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the persian accosted the young man saying o my son thou art a comely youth thou hast no sire and i have no son and i know an art than which there is no goodlier in the world many have sought of me instruction therein but i consented not to instruct any of them in it yet hath my soul consented that i teach it to thee for thy love hath gotten hold upon my heart and i will make thee my son and set up between thee and poverty a barrier so shalt thou be quit of this handicraft and toil no more with hammer and anvil fn charcoal and fire hasan asked o my lord and when wilt thou teach me this and the persian answered to morrow inshallah i will come to thee betimes and make thee in thy presence fine gold of this copper whereupon hasan rejoiced and sat talking with the persian till nightfall when he took leave of him and going in to his mother saluted her with the salam and ate with her but he was dazed without memory or reason for that the stranger s words had gotten hold upon his heart so she questioned him and he told her what had passed between himself and the persian which when she heard her heart fluttered and she strained him to her bosom saying o my son beware of hearkening to the talk of the folk and especially of the persians and obey them not in aught for they are sharpers and tricksters who profess the art of alchemy fn and swindle people and take their money and devour it in vain replied hasan o my mother we are paupers and have nothing he may covet that he should put a cheat on us indeed this persian is a right worthy shaykh and the signs of virtue are manifest on him allah hath inclined his heart to me and he hath adopted me to son she was silent in her chagrin and he passed the night without sleep his heart being full of what the persian had said to him nor did slumber visit him for the excess of his joy therein but when morning morrowed he rose and taking the keys opened the shop whereupon behold the persian accosted him hasan stood up to him and would have kissed his hands but he forbade him from this and suffered it not saying o hasan set on the crucible and apply the bellows fn so he did as the stranger bade him and lighted the charcoal then said the persian o my son hast thou any copper and he replied i have a broken platter so he bade him work the shears fn and cut it into bittocks and cast it into the crucible and blow up the fire with the bellows till the copper became liquid when he put hand to turband and took therefrom a folded paper and opening it sprinkled thereout into the pot about half a drachm of somewhat like yellow kohl or eyepowder fn then he bade hasan blow upon it with the bellows and he did so till the contents of the crucible became a lump of gold fn when the youth saw this he was stupefied and at his wits end for the joy he felt and taking the ingot from the crucible handled it and tried it with the file and found it pure gold of the finest quality whereupon his reason fled and he was dazed with excess of delight and bent over the persian s hand to kiss it but he forbade him saying art thou married and when the youth replied no he said carry this ingot to the market and sell it and take the price in haste and speak not so hasan went down into the market and gave the bar to the broker who took it and rubbed it upon the touchstone and found it pure gold so they opened the biddings at ten thousand dirhams and the merchants bid against one another for it up to fifteen thousand dirhams fn at which price he sold it and taking the money went home and told his mother all that had passed saying o my mother i have learnt this art and mystery but she laughed at him saying there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say when it was the seven hundred and eightieth night she continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when hasan the goldsmith told his mother what he had done with the ajami and cried i have learnt this art and mystery she laughed at him saying there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great and she was silent for vexation then of his ignorance he took a metal mortar and returning to the shop laid it before the persian who was still sitting there and asked him o my son what wilt thou do with this mortar hasan answered let us put it in the fire and make of it lumps of gold the persian laughed and rejoined o my son art thou jinn mad that thou wouldst go down into the market with two ingots of gold in one day knowest thou not that the folk would suspect us and our lives would be lost now o my son an i teach thee this craft thou must practise it but once in each twelvemonth for that will suffice thee from year to year cried hasan true o my lord and sitting down in his open shop set on the crucible and cast more charcoal on the fire quoth the persian what wilt thou o my son and quoth hasan teach me this craft there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great exclaimed the persian laughing verily o my son thou art little of wit and in nowise fitted for this noble craft did ever any during all his life learn this art on the beaten way or in the bazars if we busy ourselves with it here the folk will say of us these practise alchemy and the magistrates will hear of us and we shall lose our lives fn wherefore o my son an thou desire to learn this mystery forthright come thou with me to my house so hasan barred his shop and went with that ajam but by the way he remembered his mother s words and thinking in himself a thousand thoughts he stood still with bowed head the persian turned and seeing him thus standing laughed and said to him art thou mad what i in my heart purpose thee good and thou misdoubtest i will harm thee presently adding but if thou fear to go with me to my house i will go with thee to thine and teach thee there hasan replied tis well o uncle and the persian rejoined go thou before me so hasan led the way to his own house and entering told his mother of the persian s coming for he had left him standing at the door she ordered the house for them and when she had made an end of furnishing and adorning it her son bade her go to one of the neighbours lodgings so she left her home to them and wended her way whereupon hasan brought in the persian who entered after asking leave then he took in hand a dish and going to the market returned with food which he set before the persian saying eat o my lord that between us there may be bread and salt and may almighty allah do vengeance upon the traitor to bread and salt the persian replied with a smile true o my son who knoweth the virtue and worth of bread and salt fn then he came forward and ate with hasan till they were satisfied after which the ajami said o my son hasan bring us somewhat of sweetmeats so hasan went to the market rejoicing in his words and returned with ten saucers fn of sweetmeats of which they both ate and the persian said may allah abundantly requite thee o my son it is the like of thee with whom folk company and to whom they discover their secrets and teach what may profit him fn then said he o hasan bring the gear but hardly did hasan hear these words than he went forth like a colt let out to grass in spring tide and hastening to the shop fetched the apparatus and set it before the persian who pulled out a piece of paper and said o hasan by the bond of bread and salt wert thou not dearer to me than my son i would not let thee into the mysteries of this art for i have none of the elixir fn left save what is in this paper but by and by i will compound the simples whereof it is composed and will make it before thee know o my son hasan that to every ten pounds of copper thou must set half a drachm of that which is in this paper and the whole ten will presently become unalloyed virgin gold presently adding o my son o hasan there are in this paper three ounces fn egyptian measure and when it is spent i will make thee other and more hasan took the packet and finding therein a yellow powder finer than the first said to the persian o my lord what is the name of this substance and where is it found and how is it made but he laughed longing to get hold of the youth and replied of what dost thou question indeed thou art a froward boy do thy work and hold thy peace so hasan arose and fetching a brass platter from the house shore it in shreds and threw it into the melting pot then he scattered on it a little of the powder from the paper and it became a lump of pure gold when he saw this he joyed with exceeding joy and was filled with amazement and could think of nothing save the gold but whilst he was occupied with taking up the lumps of metal from the melting pot the persian pulled out of his turband in haste a packet of cretan bhang which if an elephant smelt he would sleep from night to night and cutting off a little thereof put it in a piece of the sweetmeat then said he o hasan thou art become my very son and dearer to me than soul and wealth and i have a daughter whose like never have eyes beheld for beauty and loveliness symmetry and perfect grace now i see that thou befittest none but her and she none but thee wherefore if it be allah s will i will marry thee to her replied hasan i am thy servant and whatso good thou dost with me will be a deposit with the almighty and the persian rejoined o my son have fair patience and fair shall betide thee therewith he gave him the piece of sweetmeat and he took it and kissing his hand put it in his mouth knowing not what was hidden for him in the after time for only the lord of futurity knoweth the future but hardly had he swallowed it when he fell down head foregoing heels and was lost to the world whereupon the persian seeing him in such calamitous case rejoiced exceedingly and cried thou hast fallen into my snares o gallows carrion o dog of the arabs this many a year have i sought thee and now i have found thee o hasan and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say when it was the seven hundred and eighty first night she pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when hasan the goldsmith ate the bit of sweetmeat given to him by the ajami and fell fainting to the ground the persian rejoiced exceedingly and cried this many a year have i sought thee and now i have found thee then he girt himself and pinioned hasan s arms and binding his feet to his hands laid him in a chest which he emptied to that end and locked it upon him moreover he cleared another chest and laying therein all hasan s valuables together with the piece of the first gold lump and the second ingot which he had made locked it with a padlock then he ran to the market and fetching a porter took up the two chests and made off with them to a place within sight of the city where he set them down on the sea shore hard by a vessel at anchor there now this craft had been freighted and fitted out by the persian and her master was awaiting him so when the crew saw him they came to him and bore the two chests on board then the persian called out to the rais or captain saying up and let us be off for i have done my desire and won my wish so the skipper sang out to the sailors saying weigh anchor and set sail and the ship put out to sea with a fair wind so far concerning the persian but as regards hasan s mother she awaited him till supper time but heard neither sound nor news of him so she went to the house and finding it thrown open entered and saw none therein and missed the two chests and their valuables wherefore she knew that her son was lost and that doom had overtaken him and she buffeted her face and rent her raiment crying out and wailing and saying alas my son ah alas the fruit of my vitals ah and she recited these couplets my patience fails me and grows anxiety and with your absence nbsp growth of grief i see by allah patience went what time ye went loss of all hope how nbsp suffer patiently when lost my loved one how can joy i sleep who shall enjoy nbsp such life of low degree thou rt gone and desolating house and home hast fouled the nbsp fount erst flowed from foulness free thou wast my fame my grace mid folk my stay mine aid wast nbsp thou in all adversity perish the day when from mine eyes they bore my friend till nbsp sight i thy return to me and she ceased not to weep and wail till the dawn when the neighbours came in to her and asked her of her son and she told them what had befallen him with the persian assured that she should never never see him again then she went round about the house weeping and wending she espied two lines written upon the wall so she sent for a scholar who read them to her and they were these leyla s phantom came by night when drowsiness had overcome me nbsp towards morning while my companions were sleeping in the nbsp desert but when we awoke to behold the nightly phantom i saw the air nbsp vacant and the place of visitation was distant fn when hasan s mother heard these lines she shrieked and said yes o my son indeed the house is desolate and the visitation place is distant then the neighbours took leave of her and after they had prayed that she might be vouchsafed patience and speedy reunion with her son went away but she ceased not to weep all watches of the night and tides of the day and she built amiddlemost the house a tomb whereon she let write hasan s name and the date of his loss and thenceforward she quitted it not but made a habit of incessantly biding thereby night and day such was her case but touching her son hasan and the ajami this persian was a magian who hated moslems with exceeding hatred and destroyed all who fell into his power he was a lewd and filthy villain a hankerer after alchemy an astrologer and a hunter of hidden hoards such an one as he of whom quoth the poet a dog dog fathered by dog grandsire bred no good in dog nbsp from dog race issued e en for a gnat no resting place gives he who is composed of nbsp seed by all men shed fn the name of this accursed was bahr m the guebre and he was wont every year to take a moslem and cut his throat for his own purposes so when he had carried out his plot against hasan the goldsmith they sailed on from dawn till dark when the ship made fast to the shore for the night and at sunrise when they set sail again bahram bade his black slaves and white servants bring him the chest wherein were hasan they did so and he opened it and taking out the young man made him sniff up vinegar and blew a powder into his nostrils hasan sneezed and vomited the bhang then opening his eyes he looked about him right and left and found himself amiddleward the sea on aboard a ship in full sail and saw the persian sitting by him wherefore he knew that the accursed magian had put a cheat on him and that he had fallen into the very peril against which his mother had warned him so he spake the saying which shall never shame the sayer to wit there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great verity we are allah s and unto him we are returning o my god be thou gracious to me in thine appointment and give me patience to endure this thine affliction o lord of the three worlds then he turned to the persian and bespoke him softly saying o my father what fashion is this and where is the covenant of bread and salt and the oath thou swarest to me fn but bahram stared at him and replied o dog knoweth the like of me bond of bread and salt i have slain of youths like thee a thousand save one and thou shalt make up the thousand and he cried out at him and hasan was silent knowing that the fate shaft had shot him and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say when it was the seven hundred and eighty second night she resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that when hasan beheld himself fallen into the hands of the damned persian he bespoke him softly but gained naught thereby for the ajami cried out at him in wrath so he was silent knowing that the fate shaft had shot him then the accursed bade loose his pinion bonds and they gave him a little water to drink whilst the magian laughed and said by the virtue of the fire and the light and the shade and the heat methought not thou wouldst fall into my nets but the fire empowered me over thee and helped me to lay hold upon thee that i might win my wish and return and make thee a sacrifice to her fn so she may accept of me quoth hasan thou hast foully betrayed bread and salt whereupon the magus raised his hand and dealt him such a buffet that he fell and biting the deck with his fore teeth swooned away whilst the tears trickled down his cheeks then the guebre bade his servants light him a fire and hasan said what wilt thou do with it replied the magian this is the fire lady of light and sparkles bright this it is i worship and if thou wilt worship her even as i verily i will give thee half my monies and marry thee to my maiden daughter thereupon hasan cried angrily at him woe to thee thou art a miscreant magian who to fire dost pray in lieu of the king of omnipotent sway creator of night and day and this is naught but a calamity among creeds at this the magian was wroth and said to him wilt thou not then conform with me o dog of the arabs and enter my faith but hasan consented not to this so the accursed guebre arose and prostrating himself to the fire bade his pages throw him flat on his face they did so and he beat him with a hide whip of plaited thongs fn till his flanks were laid open whilst he cried aloud for aid but none aided him and besought protection but none protected him then he raised his eyes to the all powerful king and sought of him succour in the name of the chosen prophet and indeed patience failed him his tears ran down his cheeks like rain and he repeated these couplets twain in patience o my god thy doom forecast i ll bear an thereby nbsp come thy grace at last they ve dealt us wrong transgressed and ordered ill haply thy nbsp grace shall pardon what is past then the magian bade his negro slaves raise him to a sitting posture and bring him somewhat of meat and drink so they sat food before him but he consented not to eat or drink and bahram ceased not to torment him day and night during the whole voyage whilst hasan took patience and humbled himself in supplication before almighty allah to whom belong honour and glory whereby the guebre s heart was hardened against him they ceased not to sail the sea three months during which time hasan was continually tortured till allah almighty sent forth upon them a foul wind and the sea grew black and rose against the ship by reason of the fierce gale whereupon quoth the captain and crew fn by allah this is all on account of yonder youth who hath been these three months in torture with this magian indeed this is not allowed of god the most high then they rose against the magian and slew his servants and all who were with him which when he saw he made sure of death and feared for himself so he loosed hasan from his bonds and pulling off the ragged clothes the youth had on clad him in others and made excuses to him and promised to teach him the craft and restore him to his native land saying o my son return me not evil for that i have done with thee quoth hasan how can i ever rely upon thee again and quoth bahram o my son but for sin there were no pardon indeed i did all these doings with thee but to try thy patience and thou knowest that the case is altogether in the hands of allah so the crew and captain rejoiced in hasan s release and he called down blessings on them and praised the almighty and thanked him with this the wind was stilled and the sky cleared and with a fair breeze they continued their voyage then said hasan to bahram o master fn whither wendest thou replied the magian o my son i am bound for the mountain of clouds where is the elixir which we use in alchemy and the guebre swore to him by the fire and the light that he had no longer any cause to fear him so hasan s heart was set at ease and rejoicing at the persian s words he continued to eat and drink and sleep with the magian who clad him in his own raiment they ceased not sailing on other three months when the ship came to anchor off a long shoreline of many coloured pebbles white and yellow and sky blue and black and every other hue and the magian sprang up and said o hasan come let us go ashore for we have reached the place of our wish and will so hasan rose and landed with bahram after the persian had commended his goods to the captain s care they walked on inland till they were far enough from the ship to be out of sight when bahram sat down and taking from his pocket a kettle drum fn of copper and a silken strap worked in gold with characts beat the drum with the strap until there arose a cloud of dust from the further side of the waste hasan marvelled at the magian s doings and was afraid of him he repented of having come ashore with him and his colour changed but bahram looked at him and said what aileth thee o my son by the truth of the fire and the light thou hast naught to fear from me and were it not that my wish may never be won save by thy means i had not brought thee ashore so rejoice in all good for yonder cloud of dust is the dust of somewhat we will mount and which will aid us to cut across this wold and make easy to us the hardships thereof and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say when it was the seven hundred and eighty third night she continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that the persian said to hasan in very sooth yonder dust cloud is the cloud of something we will mount and which will aid us to cut across this wold and will make easy to us the hardships thereof presently the dust lifted off three she dromedaries one of which bahram mounted and hasan another then they loaded their victual on the third and fared on seven days till they came to a wide champaign and descending into its midst they saw a dome vaulted upon four pilasters of red gold so they alighted and entering thereunder ate and drank and took their rest anon hasan chanced to glance aside and seeing from afar a something lofty said to the magian what is that o nuncle bahram replied tis a palace and quoth hasan wilt thou not go thither that we may enter and there repose ourselves and solace ourselves with inspecting it but the persian was wroth and said name not to me yonder palace for therein dwelleth a foe with whom there befel me somewhat whereof this is no time to tell thee then he beat the kettle drum and up came the dromedaries and they mounted and fared on other seven days on the eighth day the magian said o hasan what seest thou hasan replied i see clouds and mists twixt east and west quoth bahram that is neither clouds nor mists but a vast mountain and a lofty whereon the clouds split fn and there are no clouds above it for its exceeding height and surpassing elevation yon mount is my goal and thereon is the need we seek tis for that i brought thee hither for my wish may not be won save at thy hands hasan hearing this gave his life up for lost and said to the magian by the right of that thou worshippest and by the faith wherein thou believest i conjure thee to tell me what is the object wherefor thou hast brought me bahram replied the art of alchemy may not be accomplished save by means of a herb which groweth in the place where the clouds pass and whereon they split such a site is yonder mountain upon whose head the herb groweth and i purpose to send thee up thither to fetch it and when we have it i will show thee the secret of this craft which thou desirest to learn hasan answered in his fear tis well o my master and indeed he despaired of life and wept for his parting from his parent and people and patrial stead repenting him of having gainsaid his mother and reciting these two couplets consider but thy lord his work shall bring comfort to thee nbsp with quick relief and near despair not when thou sufferest sorest bane in bane how many nbsp blessed boons appear they ceased not faring on till they came to the foothills of that mountain where they halted and hasan saw thereon a palace and asked bahram what be yonder palace whereto he answered tis the abode of the jann and ghuls and satans then the magian alighted and making hasan also dismount from his dromedary kissed his head and said to him bear me no ill will anent that i did with thee for i will keep guard over thee in thine ascent to the palace and i conjure thee not to trick and cheat me of aught thou shalt bring therefrom and i and thou will share equally therein and hasan replied to hear is to obey then bahram opened a bag and taking out a handmill and a sufficiency of wheat ground the grain and kneaded three round cakes of the flour after which he lighted a fire and baked the bannocks then he took out the copper kettledrum and beat it with the broidered strap whereupon up came the dromedaries he chose out one and said hearken o my son o hasan to what i am about to enjoin on thee and hasan replied tis well bahram continued lie down on this skin and i will sew thee up therein and lay thee on the ground whereupon the rakham birds fn will come to thee and carry thee up to the mountain top take this knife with thee and when thou feelest that the birds have done flying and have set thee down slit open therewith the skin and come forth the vultures will then take fright at thee and fly away whereupon do thou look down from the mountain head and speak to me and i will tell thee what to do so he sewed him up in the skin placing therein three cakes and a leathern bottle full of water and withdrew to a distance presently a vulture pounced upon him and taking him up flew away with him to the mountain top and there set him down as soon as hasan felt himself on the ground he slit the skin and coming forth called out to the magian who hearing his speech rejoiced and danced for excess of joy saying to him look behind thee and tell me what thou seest hasan looked and seeing many rotten bones and much wood told bahram who said to him this be what we need and seek make six bundles of the wood and throw them down to me for this is wherewithal we do alchemy so he threw him the six bundles and when he had gotten them into his power he said to hasan o gallows bird i have won my wish of thee and now if thou wilt thou mayst abide on this mountain or cast thyself down to the earth and perish so saying he left him fn and went away and hasan exclaimed there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great this hound hath played the traitor with me and he sat bemoaning himself and reciting these couplets when god upon a man possessed of reasoning hearing and sight nbsp his will in aught to pass would bring he stops his ears and blinds his eyes and draws his wit from nbsp him as one draws out the hairs to paste that cling till his decrees fulfilled he gives him back his wit that nbsp therewithal he may receive admonishing so say thou not of aught that haps how happened it for fate nbsp and fortune fixed do order everything fn and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say when it was the seven hundred and eighty fourth night she pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the magian sent hasan to the mountain top and made him throw down all he required he presently reviled him and left him and wended his ways and the youth exclaimed there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great this damned hound hath played the traitor then he rose to his feet and looked right and left after which he walked on along the mountain top in mind making certain of death he fared on thus till he came to the counterslope of the mountain along which he saw a dark blue sea dashing with billows clashing and yeasting waves each as it were a lofty mount so he sat down and repeated what he might of the koran and besought allah the most high to ease him of his troubles or by death or by deliverance from such strait then he recited for himself the funeral prayer fn and cast himself down into the main but the waves bore him up by allah s grace so that he reached the water unhurt and the angel in whose charge is the sea watched over him so that the billows bore him safe to land by the decree of the most high thereupon he rejoiced and praised almighty allah and thanked him after which he walked on in quest of something to eat for stress of hunger and came presently to the place where he had halted with the magian bahram then he fared on awhile till behold he caught sight of a great palace rising high in air and knew it for that of which he had questioned the persian and he had replied therein dwelleth a foe of mine hasan said to himself by allah needs must i enter yonder palace perchance relief awaiteth me there so coming to it and finding the gate open he entered the vestibule where he saw seated on a bench two girls like twin moons with a chess cloth before them and they were at play one of them raised her head to him and cried out for joy saying by allah here is a son of adam and methinks tis he whom bahram the magian brought hither this year so hasan hearing her words cast himself at their feet and wept with sore weeping and said yes o my ladies by allah i am indeed that unhappy then said the younger damsel to her elder sister bear witness against me fn o my sister that this is my brother by covenant of allah and that i will die for his death and live for his life and joy for his joy and mourn for his mourning so saying she rose and embraced him and kissed him and presently taking him by the hand and her sister with her led him into the palace where she did off his ragged clothes and brought him a suit of king s raiment wherewith she,"['flow', 'page', 'adversity', 'dog', 'slave', 'laugh', 'powerful', 'wail',

lyricsdear president obama good luck on your journeys overseas this week and congratulations on decisively winning your second term as our president the first time you won four years ago most of us couldn t contain our joy and found ourselves literally in tears over your victory this time it was more like breathing a huge sigh of relief but like the smooth guy you are you scored the highest percentage of the vote of any democrat since lyndon johnson and you racked up the most votes for a democratic president in the history of the united states the only one to receive more votes than you was you in you are the first democrat to get more than percent of the vote twice in a row since franklin d roosevelt this was truly another historic election and i would like to take a few minutes of your time to respectfully ask that your second term not resemble your first term it s not that you didn t get anything done you got a lot done but there are some very huge issues that have been left unresolved and dammit we need you to get some fight in you wall street and the uber rich have been conducting a bloody class war for over years and it s about time they were stopped i know it is not in your nature to be aggressive or confrontational but please barack do not listen to the pundits who are telling you to make the grand compromise or move to the center fyi you re already there your fellow citizens have spoken and we have rejected the crazed ideology of this republican party and we insist that you forcefully proceed in bringing about profound change that will improve the lives of the percent we re done hoping we want real change and if we can t get it in the second term of a great and good man like you then really what s the use why are we even bothering yes we re that discouraged and disenchanted at your first post election press conference last wednesday you were on fire the way you went all taxi driver on mccain and company you talkin to me was so brilliant and breathtaking i had to play it back a dozen times just to maintain the contact high jesus that look for a second i thought laser beams would be shooting out of your eyes more of that please in the weeks after your first election you celebrated by hiring the goldman sachs boys and wall street darlings to run our economy talk about a buzzkill that i never fully recovered from please not this time this time take a stand for all the rest of us and if you do tens of millions of us will not only have your back we will swoop down on congress in a force so large they won t know what hit them that s right mcconnell you re on the retirement list we ve put together for but first you have to do the job we elected you to do you have to take your massive electoral vote margin and just go for it here are my suggestions drive the rich right off their fiscal cliff the fiscal cliff is a ruse an invention by the right and the rich to try and keep their huge tax breaks on december let all the tax cuts expire then on january put forth a bill that restores the tax cuts for percent of the public i dare the republicans to vote against that they can t and they won t as for the spending cuts the agreement states that for every domestic program dollar the republicans want to cut a pentagon dollar must also be cut see you are a genius no way will the right vote against the masters of war and if by some chance they do you can immediately put forth legislation to restore all the programs we the majority approve of and for god s sake man declare social security and medicare medicaid untouchable they re not bankrupt or anywhere near it if the rich paid the same percentage of social security tax on their entire income the same exact rate everyone else pays then there will suddenly be enough money in social security to last til at least the year end all the wars now do not continue the war in afghanistan a thoroughly losing proposition if ever there was one for two full more years why should one single more person have to die for no reason stop it you know it s wrong bin laden s dead al qaeda is decimated and the afghans have to work out their own problems also end the drone strikes and other covert military activities you are conducting in pakistan yemen somalia colombia and god knows where else you think history is going to remember the united states as a great democracy no they re going to think of us as a nation that became addicted to war they ll call us warlords they ll say that in the st century america was so in need of oil that we d kill anyone to get it you know that s where this is going this has to stop now end the drug war it is not only an abysmal failure it has returned us to the days of slavery we have locked up millions of african americans and latinos and now fund a private prison industrial complex that makes billions for a few lucky rich people there are other ways to deal with the drugs that do cause harm ways built around a sense of decency and compassion we look like a bunch of sadistic racists stop it declare a moratorium on home foreclosures and evictions millions of people are facing homelessness because of a crooked system enacted by the major banks and wall street firms put a pause on this and take months to work out a different way like restructuring families mortgages to reflect the true worth of their homes get money out of politics you already know this one the public is sick of it now s the time to act expand obamacare your health care law doesn t cover everyone it is a cash cow for the insurance industry push for a single payer system medicare for all and include dentistry and mental health this is the single biggest thing you could do to reduce the country s deficit restore glass steagall you must put back all the rigid controls on wall street that reagan clinton and the bushes removed or else we face the possibility of another much worse crash if they break the law prosecute them the way you currently go after whistleblowers and medical marijuana dispensaries reduce student loan debt no year old should have to enter the real world already in a virtual debtors prison this is cruel and no other democracy does this like we do you were right to eliminate the banks as the profit gouging lenders but now you have to bring us back to the days when you and i were of college age and a good education cost us little or next to nothing a few less wars would go a long to way to being able to afford this free bradley manning end the persecution and prosecution of an american hero bush and cheney lied to a nation to convince us to go to war manning allegedly hacked the war criminals files and then shared them with the american public and the world so that we could learn the truth about iraq and afghanistan our history is full of such people who break the law for the greater good of humanity army specialist bradley manning deserves a medal not prison ask us to do something one thing is clear none of the above is going to happen if you don t immediately mobilize the who voted for you and the other million who are for you but didn t vote you can t go this alone you need an army of everyday americans who will fight alongside you to make this a more just and peaceful nation in your campaign you were a pioneer in using social media to win the election over million of us gave you our cell numbers or email addresses so you could send us texts and emails telling us what needed to be done to win the election then as soon as you won it was as if you hit the delete button we never heard from you again until this past year when you kept texting us to send you inspiring whoever your internet and social media people were should have been given their own office in the west wing and we should have heard from you constantly need a bill passed text us and we will mobilize the republicans are filibustering we can stop them they won t approve your choice for secretary of state we ll see about that you say you were a community organizer please start acting like one the next four years can be one of those presidential terms that changed the course of america i m sure you will want to be judged on how you stood up for us restored the middle class ended the s ting on the poor and made us a friend to the rest of the world instead of a threat you can do this we can do it with you all that stands in the way is your understandable desire to sing kumbaya with the republicans don t waste your breath their professed love of america is negated by their profound hatred of you don t waste a minute on them fix the sad mess we re in go back and read this month s election results we re with you embed,"['threat', 'bankrupt', 'luck', 'ruse', 'mess', 'lender', 'west', 'racist',

premier amour by edition de minuit paris english trans published by calder and boyars brewer st london in isbn square brackets in the copy below mark the end of each page in the syrens edition i e penguin i associate rightly or wrongly my marriage with the death of my father in time that other links exist on other levels between these two affairs is not impossible i have enough trouble as it is in trying to say what i think i know i visited not so long ago my father s grave that i do know and noted the date of his death of his death alone for that of his birth had no interest for me on that particular day i set out in the morning and was back by night having lunched lightly in the grave yard but some days later wishing to know his age at death i had to return to the grave to note the date of his birth these two limiting dates i then jotted down on a piece of paper which i now carry about with me i am thus in a position to affirm that i must have been about twenty five at the time of my marriage for the date of my own birth i repeat my own birth i have never forgotten i never had to note it down it remains graven in my memory the year at least in figures that life will not easily erase the day itself comes back to me when i put my mind to it and i often cele brate it after my fashion i don t say each time it comes back for it comes back too often but often personally i have no bone to pick with graveyards i take the air there willingly perhaps more willingly than elsewhere when take the air i must the smell of corpses distinctly per ceptible under those of grass and humus mingled i do not find un pleasant a trifle on the sweet side perhaps a trifle heady but how in finitely preferable to what the living emit their feet teeth armpits arses sticky foreskins and frustrated ovules and when my father s remains join in however modestly i can almost shed a tear the living wash in vain in vain perfume themselves they stink yes as a place for an outing when out i must leave me my graveyards and keep you to your public parks and beauty spots my sandwich my banana taste sweeter when i m sitting on a tomb and when the time comes to piss again as it so often does i have my pick or i wander hands clasped behind my back among the slabs the flat the leaning and the upright cul ling the inscriptions of these i never weary there are always three or four of such drollery that i have to hold on to the cross or the stele or the angel so as not to fall mine i composed long since and am still pleased with it tolerably pleased my other writings are no sooner dry than they revolt me but my epitaph still meets with my approval there is little chance unfortunately of its ever being reared above the skull that conceived it unless the state takes up the matter but to be unearthed i must first be found and i greatly fear those gentle men will have as much trouble finding me dead as alive so i hasten to record it here and now while there is yet time i hereunder lies the above who up below so hourly died that he lived on till now the second and last or rather latter line limps a little perhaps but that is no great matter i ll be forgiven more than that when i m forgotten then with a little luck you hit on a genuine interment with real live mourners and the odd relict trying to throw herself into the pit and nearly always that charming business with the dust though in my experience there is nothing less dusty than holes of this type verging on muck for the most part nor anything particularly pow dery about the deceased unless he happen to have died or she by fire no matter their little gimmick with the dust is charming but my father s yard was not among my favourite to begin with it was too remote way out in the wilds of the country on the side of a hill and too small far too small to go on with indeed it was almost full a few more widows and they d be turning them away i in finitely preferred ohlsdorf particu larly the linne section on prussian soil with its nine hundred acres of corpses packed tight though i knew no one there except by reputation the wild animal collector hagenbeck a lion if i remember right is carved on his monument death must have had for hagenbeck the countenance of a lion coaches ply to and fro crammed with widows widowers orphans and the like groves grottoes artificial lakes with swans offer consolation to the inconsolable it was december i had never felt so cold the eel soup lay heavy on my stomach i was afraid i d die i turned aside to vomit i envied them but to pass on to less melancholy matters on my father s death i had to leave the house it was he who wanted me in the house he was a strange man one day he said leave him alone he s not disturbing anyone he didn t know i was listening this was a view he must have often voiced but the other times i wasn t by they would never let me see his will they simply said he had left me such a sum i believed then and still believe he had stipulated in his will that i be left the room i had occupied in his lifetime and food brought me there as hitherto he may even have given this the force of condition precedent presumably he liked to feel me under his roof otherwise he would not have opposed my eviction perhaps he merely pitied me but somehow i think not he should have left me the entire house then i d have been all right the others too for that matter i d have summoned them and said stay stay by all means your home is here yes he was properly had my poor father if his purpose was really to go on protecting me from beyond the tomb with regard to the money it is only fair to say they gave it to me without delay on the very day fol lowing the inhumation perhaps they were legally bound to i said to them keep this money and let me live on here in my room as in papa s life time i added god rest his soul in the hope of melting them but they re fused i offered to place myself at their disposal a few hours every day for the little odd maintenance jobs every dwelling requires if it is not to crumble away pottering is still just possible i don t know why i proposed in particular to look after the hothouse there i would have gladly whiled away the hours in the heat tending the tomatoes hyacinths pinks and seedlings my father and i alone in that household understood tomatoes but they refused one day on my return from stool i found my room locked and my belongings in a heap before the door this will give you some idea how constipated i was at that juncture it was i am now con vinced anxiety constipation but was i genuinely constipated somehow i think not softly softly and yet i must have been for how otherwise account for those long those cruel sessions in the necessary house at such times i never read any more than at other times never gave way to revery or meditation just gazed dully at the almanac hanging from a nail before my eyes with its chromo of a bearded stripling in the midst of sheep jesus no doubt parted the cheeks with both hands and strained heave ho heave ho with the motions of one tugging at the oar and only one thought in my mind to be back in my room and flat on my back again what can that have been but con stipation or am i confusing it with the diarrhoea it s all a muddle in my head graves and nuptials and the dif ferent varieties of motion of my scanty belongings they had made a little heap on the floor against the door i can still see that little heap in the kind of recess full of shadow between the landing and my room it was in this narrow space guarded on three sides only that i had to change i mean exchange my dressing gown and nightgown for my travelling cos tume i mean shoes socks trousers shirt coat greatcoat and hat i can think of nothing else i tried other doors turning the knobs and pushing or pulling before i left the house but none yielded i think if i d found one open i d have barricaded myselfin the room nothing less than gas would have dislodged me i felt the house crammed as usual the usual pack but saw no one i imagined them in their various rooms all bolts drawn every sense on the alert then the rush to the window each holding back a little hidden by the curtain at the sound of the street door closing behind me i should haveleft it open then the doors fly open and out they pour men women and children and the voices the sighs the smiles the hands the keys in the hands the blessed relief the pre cautions rehearsed if this then that but if that then this allclear and joy in every heart come let s eat the fumigation can wait all imagination to be sure i was already on my way things may have passed quite differently but who cares how things pass provided they pass all those lips that had kissed me those hearts that had loved me it is with the heart one loves is it not or am i confusing it with something else those hands that had played with mine and those minds that had almost made their own of me humans are truly strange poor papa a nice mug he must have felt that day if he could see me see us a nice mug on my account i mean unless in his great disembodied wisdom he saw further than his son whose corpse was not yet quite up to scratch but to pass on to less melancholy matters the name of the woman with whom i was soon to be united was lulu so at least she assured me and i can t see what interest she could have had in lying to me on this score of course one can never tell she also disclosed her family name but i ve forgotten it i should have made a note of it on a piece of paper i hate to forget a proper name i met her on a bench on the bank of the canal one of the canals for our town boasts two though i never knew which was which it was a well situated bench backed by a mound of solid earth and garbage so that my rear was covered my flanks too partially thanks to a pair of venerable trees more than venerable dead at either end of the bench it was no doubt these trees one fine day aripple with all their foliage that had sown the idea of a bench in someone s fancy to the fore a few yards away flowed the canal if canals flow don t ask me so that from that quarter too the risk of sur prise was small and yet she surprised me i lay stretched out the night being warm gazing up through the bare boughs interlocking high above me where the trees clung together for support and through the drifting cloud at a patch of starry sky as it came and went shove up she said my first movement was to go but my fatigue and my having nowhere to go dissuaded me from acting on it so i drew back my feet a little way and she sat nothing more passed between us that evening and she soon took herself off without another word all she had done was sing beneath her breath as to herself and without the words fortunately some old folk songs and so disjointedly skip ping from one to another and finishing none that even i found it strange the voice though out of tune was not unpleasant it breathed of a soul too soon wearied ever to conclude that perhaps least arse aching soul of all the bench itself was soon more than she could bear and as for me one look had been enough for her whereas in reality she was a most tenacious woman she came back next day and the day after and all went off more or less as before perhaps a few words were exchanged the next day it was raining and i felt in security wrong again i asked her if she was resolved to disturb me every evening i disturb you she said i felt her eyes on me they can t have seen much two eye lids at the most with a hint of nose and brow darkly because of the dark i thought we were easy she said you disturb me i said i can t stretch out with you there the collar of my greatcoat was over my mouth and yet she heard me must you stretch out she said the mistake one makes is to speak to people you have only to put your feet on my knees she said i didn t wait to be asked twice under my miserable calves i felt her fat thighs she began stroking my ankles i considered kicking her in the cunt you speak to people about stretching out and they immediately see a body at full length what mattered to me in my dispeopled kingdom that in regard to which the disposition of my carcass was the merest and most futile of accidents was supineness in the mind the dulling of the self and of that residue of execrable frippery known as the non self and even the world for short but man is still today at the age of twenty five at the mercy of an erection physically too from time to time it s the common lot even i was not immune if that may be called an erection it did not escape her naturally women smell a rigid phallus ten miles away and won der how on earth did he spot me from there one is no longer oneself on such occasions and it is painful to be no longer oneself even more painful if possible than when one is for when one is one knows what to do to be less so whereas when one is not one is any old one irredeemably what goes by the name of love is banishment with now and then a postcard from the homeland such is my considered opinion this evening when she had finished and my self been resumed mine own the mitig able with the help of a brief torpor it was alone i sometimes wonder if that is not all invention if in reality things did not take quite a different course one i had no choice but to forget and yet her image remains bound for me to that of the bench not the bench by day nor yet the bench by night but the bench at evening in such sort that to speak of the bench as it appeared to me at evening is to speak of her for me that proves nothing but there is nothing i wish to prove on the subject of the bench by day no words need be wasted it never knew me gone before morning and never back till dusk yes in the daytime i foraged for food and marked down likely cover were you to inquire as un doubtedly you itch what i had done with the money my father had left me the answer would be i had done nothing with it but leave it lie in my pocket for i knew i would not be always young and that summer does not last for ever either nor even autumn my mean soul told me so in the end i told her i d had enough she disturbed me exceedingly even absent indeed she still disturbs me but no worse now than the rest and it matters nothing to me now to be dis turbed or so little what does it mean disturbed and what would i do with myself if i wasn t yes i ve changed my system it s the winning one at last for the ninth or tenth time not to mention not long now not long till curtain down on disturbers and dis turbed no more tattle about that all that her and the others the shitball and heaven s high halls so you don t want me to come any more she said it s incredible the way they repeat what you ve just said to them as if they risked faggot and fire in believ ing their ears i told her to come just the odd time i didn t understand women at that period i still don t for that matter nor men either nor animals either what i understand best which is not saying much are my pains i think them through daily it doesn t take long thought moves so fast but they are not only in my thought not all yes there are moments particularlyin the afternoon when i go all syncretist a la reinhold what equilibrium but even them my pains i understand ill that must come from my not being all pain and nothing else there s the rub then they recede or i till they fill me with amase and wonder seen from a better planet not often but i ask no more catch cony life to be nothing but pain how that would simplify matters omnidolent impious dream i ll tell them to you some day none the less if i think of it if i can my strange pains in detail distinguishing between the different kinds for the sake of clarity those of the mind those of the heart or emotional conative those of the soul none prettier than these and finally those of the frame proper first the inner or latent then those affecting the surface beginning with the hair and scalp and moving method ically down without haste all the way down to the feet beloved of the corn the cramp the kibe the bunion the hammer toe the nail ingrown the fallen arch the common blain the club foot duck foot goose foot pigeon foot flat foot trench foot and other curiosities and i ll tell by the same token for those kind enough to listen in accordance with a system whose inventor i forget of those in stants when neither drugged nor drunk nor in ecstasy one feels nothing next of course she desired to know what i meant by the odd time that s what you get for opening your mouth once a week once in ten days once a fortnight i replied less often far less often less often to the point of no more if she could and if she could not the least often pos sible and the next day what is more i abandoned the bench less i must confess on her account that on its for the site no longer answered my re quirements modest though they were now that the air was beginning to strike chill and for other reasons better not wasted on cunts like you and took refuge in a deserted cowshed marked on one of my forays it stood in the corner of a field richer on the surface in nettles than in grass and in mud than in nettles but whose sub soil was perhaps possessed of excep tional qualities it was in this byre littered with dry and hollow cowclaps subsiding with a sigh at the poke of my finger that for the first time in my life and i would not hesitate to say the last if i had not to husband my cyanide i had to contend with a feeling which gradually assumed to my dismay the dread name of love what constitutes the charm of our country apart of course from its scant population and this without help of the meanest contraceptive is that all is derelict with the sole exception of history s ancient faeces these are ardently soughtf after stuffed and carried in procession wherever nauseated time has dropped anicefat turd you will find our patriots sniffmg it up on all fours their faces on fire elysium of the roofless hence my happiness at last lie down all seems to say lie down and stay down i see no connexion between these remarks but that one exists and even more than one i have little doubt for my part but what which yes i loved her it s the name i gave still give alas to what i was doing then i had nothing to go by having never loved before but of course had heard of the thing at home in school in brothel and at church and read ro mances in prose and verse under the guidance of my tutor in six or seven languages both dead and living in which it was handled at length i was therefore in a position in spite of all to put a label on what i was about when i found myself inscribing the letters of lulu in an old heifer patyor flat on my face in the mud under the moon trying to tear up the nettles by the roots they were giant nettles some full three foot high to tear them up assuaged my pain and yet it s not like me to do that to weeds on the contrary i d smother them in manure if i had any flowers are a diffierent matter love brings out the worst in man and no error but what kind of love was this exactly love passion somehow i think not that s the priapic one is it not or is this a different variety there are so many are there not all equally if not more delicious are they not platonic love for example there s anotherjust occurs to me it s disinterested perhaps i loved her with a platonic love but somehow i think not would i have been tracing her name in old cowshit if my love had been pure and dis interested and with my devil s finger into the bargain which i then sucked come now my thoughts were all of lulu if that doesn t give you some idea nothing will anyhow i m sick and tired of this name lulu i ll give her another more like her anna for example it s not more like her but no matter i thought of anna then i who had learnt to think of nothing nothing except my pains a quick think through and of what steps to take not to perish os hand of hunger or cold or shame but never on any account of living beings as such i wonder what that means whatever i may have said or may still say to the contrary or otherwise on this subject but i have always spoken no doubt always shall of things that never exis ted or that existed if you insist no doubt always will but not with the existence i ascribe to them kepis for example exist beyond a doubt indeed there is little hope of their ever dis appearing but personally i never wore a kepi i wrote somewhere they gave me a hat now the truth is they never gave me a hat i have always had my own hat the one my father gave me and i have never had any other hat than that hat i may add it has followed me to the grave i thought of anna then long long sessions twenty minutes twenty five minutes and even as long as half an hour daily i obtain these figures by the addition of other lesser figures that must have been my way of loving are we to infer from this i loved her with that intellectual love which drew from me such drivel in another place somehow i think not for had my love been of this kind would i have stooped to inscribe the letters of anna in time s forgotten cowplats to divellicate urtica plenis manibus and felt under my tossing head her thighs to bounce like so many demon bolsters come now in order to put an end to try and put an end to this plight i returned one evening to the bench at the hour she had used to join me there there was no sign of her and i waited in vain it was december already if notjanuary and the cold was seasonable that is to say reasonable like all that is season able but one is the hour of the dial and another that of changing air and sky and another yet again the heart s to this thought once back in the straw i owed an excellent night the next day i was earlier to the bench much earlier night having barely fallen winter night and yet too late for she was there already on the bench under the boughs tinkling with rime her back to the frosted mound facing the icy water i told you she was a highly tenacious woman i felt nothing what interest could she have in pursuing me thus i asked her with out sitting down stumping to and fro the cold had embossed the path she replied she didn t know what could she see in me would she kindly tell me that at least if she could she replied she couldn t she seemed warmly clad her hands buried in a muff as i looked at this muff i remember tears came to my eyes and yet i forget what colour it was the state i was in then i have always wept freely without the least benefit to myself till recently if i had to weep this minute i could squeese till i was blue i m convinced not a drop would fall the state i am in nowl it was things made me weep and yet i felt no sorrow when i found myself in tears for no apparent reason it meant i had caught sight of something un beknownst so i wonder if it was really the muff that evening if it was not rather the path so iron hard and bossy as perhaps to feel like cobbles to my tread or some other thing some chance thing glimpsed below the threshold that so unmanned me as for her i might as well never have laid eyes on her before she sat all huddled and muffled up her head sunk the muff with her hands in her lap her legs pressed tight together her heels clear of the ground shapeless ageless almost lifeless it might have been anything or anyone an old woman or a little girl and the way she kept on saying i don t know i can t i alone did not know and could not is it on my account you came i said she managed yes to that well here i am i said and i had i not come on hers here we are i said i sat down beside her but sprang up again immediately as though scalded i longed to be gone to know if it was over but before going to be on the safe side i asked her to sing me a song i thought at first she was going to refuse i mean simply not sing but no after a moment she began to sing and sang for some time all the time the same song it seemed to me with out change of attitude i did not know the song i had never heard it before and shall never hear it again it had something to do with lemon trees or orange trees i forget that is all i remember and for me that is no mean feat to remember it had something to do with lemon trees or orange trees i forget for of all the other songs i have ever heard in my life and i have heard plenty it being apparently im possible physically impossible short of being deaf to get through this world even my way without hearing singing i have retained nothing not a word not a note or so few words so few notes that that what that nothing this sentence has gone on long enough then i started to go and as i went i heard her singing another song or perhaps more verses of the same fainter and fainter the further i went then no more either because she had come to an end or because i was gone too far to hear her to have to harbour such a doubt was some thing i preferred to avoid at that period i lived of course in doubt on doubt but such trivial doubts as this purely somatic as some say were best cleared up without delay they could nag at me like gnats for weeks on end so i retraced my steps a little way and stopped at first i heard nothing then the voice again but only just so faintly did it carry first i didn t hear it then i did i must therefore have begun hearing it at a certain point but no there was no beginning the sound emerged so softly from the silence and so resembled it when the voice ceased at last i approached a little nearer to make sure it had really ceased and not merely been lowered then in despair saying no knowing no knowing short of being beside her bent over her i turned on my heel and went for good full of doubt but some weeks later even more dead than alive than usual i returned to the bench for the fourth or fifth time since i had abandoned it at roughly the same hour i mean roughly the same sky no i don t mean that either for it s always the same sky and never the same sky what words are there for that none i know period she wasn t there then suddenly she was i don t know how i didn t see her come nor hear her all ears and eyes though i was let us say it was raining nothing like a change if only of weather she had her umbrella up naturally what an outfit i asked if she came every evening no she said just the odd time the bench was soaking wet we paced up and down not daring to sit i took her arm out of curiosity to see if it would give me pleasure it gave me none i let it go but why these particulars to put off the evil hour i saw her face a little clearer it seemed normal to me a face like millions of others the eyes were crooked but i didn t know that till later it looked neither young nor old the face as though stranded between the vernal and the sere such ambiguity i found difficult to bear at that period as to whether it was beautiful the face or had once been beautiful or could con ceivably become beautiful i confess i could form no opinion i had seen faces in photographs i might have found beautiful had i known even vaguely in what beauty was supposed to consist and my father s face on his death bolster had seemed to hint at some form of aesthetics relevant to man but the faces of the living all grimace and flush can they be des cribed as objects i admired in spite of the dark in spite of my fluster the way still or scarcely flowing water reaches up as though athirst to that falling from the sky she asked if i would like her to sing something i replied no i would like her to say something i thought she would say she had nothing to say it would have been like her and so was agreeably surprised when she said she had a room most agreeably surprised though i suspected as much who has not a room ah i hear the clamour i have two rooms she said just how many rooms do you have i said she said she had two rooms and a kitchen the premises were expanding steadily given time she would remember a bathroom is it two rooms i heard you say i said yes she said adjacent i said at last conversation worthy of the name separated by the kitchen she said i asked her why she had not told me before i must have been beside myself at this period i did not feel easy when i was with her but at least free to think of something else than her of the old trusty things and so little by little as down steps to wards a deep of nothing and i knew that away from her i would forfeit this freedom there were in fact two rooms separated by a kitchen she had not lied to me she said i should have fetched my things i explained i had no things it was at the top of an old house with a view of the mountains for those who cared she lit an oil lamp you have no current i said no she said but i have running water and gas ha i said you have gas she began to undress when at their wit s end they undress no doubt the wisest course she took off everything with a slowness fit to enflame an elephant except her stockings calculated pre sumably to bring my concupiscence to the boil it was then i noticed the squint fortunately she was not the first naked woman to have crossed my path so i could stay i knew she would not explode i asked to see the other room which i had not yet seen if i had seen it already i would have asked to see it again will you not undress she said oh you know i said i seldom undress it was the truth i was never one to undress indiscriminately i often took offmy boots when i went to bed i mean when i composed myself composed to sleep not to mention this or that outer garment according to the outer temperature she was therefore obliged out of common savoir faire to throw on a wrap and light me the way we went via the kitchen we could just as well have gone via the corridor as i realized later but we went via the kitchen i don t know why perhaps it was the shorter way i surveyed the room with horror such density of furniture defeats imagination not a doubt i must have seen that room somewhere what s this i cried the parlour she said the parlour i began putting out the furniture through the door to the corridor she watched in sorrow i suppose but not necessarily she asked me what i was doing she can t have expected an answer i put it out piece by piece and even two at a time and stacked it all up in the cor ridor against the outer wall they were hundreds of pieces large and small in the end they blocked the door making egress impossible and a fortiori ingress to and from the cor ridor the door could be opened and closed since it opened inwards but had become impassable to put it wildly at least take off your hat she said i ll treat of my hat some other time perhaps finally the room was empty but for a sofa and some shelves fixed to the wall the former i dragged to the back of the room near the door and next day took down the latter and put them out in the corridor with the rest as i was taking them down strange memory i heard the word fibrome or brone i don t know which never knew never knew what it meant and never had the curiosity to find out the things one recalls and records when all was in order at last i dropped on the sofa she had not raised her little finger to help me i ll get sheets and blankets she said but i wouldn t hear of sheets you couldn t draw the curtain i said the window was frosted over the effiect was not white because of the night but faintly luminous none the less this faint cold sheen though i lay with my feet towards the door was more than i could bear i suddenly rose and changed the position of the sofa that is to say turned it round so that the back hitherto against the wall was now on the outside and consequently the front or way in on the inside then i climbed back like a dog into its basket i ll leave you the lamp she said but i begged her to take it with her and suppose you need something in the night she said she was going to start quibbling again i could feel it do you know where the convenience is she said she was right i was forgetting to relieve oneself in bed is enjoyable at the time but soon a source of discomfort give me a chamber pot i said but she did not possess one i have a close stool of sorts she said i saw the grandmother on it sitting up very stiff and grand having just purchased it pardon picked it up at a charity sale or perhaps won it in a raffle a period piece and now trying it out doing her best rather almost wishing some one could see her that s the idea procrastinate any old recipient i said i don t have the flux she came back with a kind of saucepan not a true saucepan for it had no handle it was oval in shape with two lugs and a lid my stewpan she said i don t need the lid i said you don t need the lid she said if i had said i needed the lid she would have said you need the lid i drew this utensil down under the blanket i like something in my hand when,"['page', 'flow', 'forfeit', 'dog', 'drop', 'banana', 'hint', 'note',

cause tony d is a front now who is the real champ let s settle that shit you the greatest on your scene i m the greatest on the atlas access to access i straddle the map and scratch chess who s ass next i got a gat left with a big black x like your mother you don t even have that champion vibe sucky face lookin all like his whole family just died anthony s pride look a real champ in his eyes who had the balls to man up and fly all the way from canada cause i m a true champion and i stand up with pride you only battle on your own homeland where you side where your people chant every line and your punches land every time it s so easy an old pc he needs the fans on his side cause he knows outside of don t flop he d never get that same respect battle once on king of the dot never seen his face again he knows outside of don t flop he d never have that same effect battled once on king of the dot never seen his face again all cause he choked up so what you oughta shake ya head a real champ would come back stronger that s how you gain respect you d never be a main event no one even knows your name but them you don t even have a big enough buzz for other leagues to pay you yet how dare you compare you to me should put his ass in the razor s edge break his neck put the can to his mouth like take ya friends i m back watchin these suckers uh oh there he go the old pat s back england s lovin it cheerio i m loony don t dare me bro believe me shit can get scary bro when we met we left on a high note but i m very low i ll bury tone baritone you thought that marv won shit was rough you know what rhymes with awareness for autism month who gives a fuck hear about your sister s abortion ain t that a drag know what rhymes with wish she had a rag scrambled eggs hey man walked out the door and called her a whore she said you re kiddin your kid in me he said not anymore you re kiddin me look all ages are pissed at me abortion jokes are fine it s all in the delivery aye round it s gettin hot in here yo fellas you know my slogan get the fuck outta here nah wear a rubber get your dna the fuck outta here round tony d so they put the former champ versus the former champ made sense right on paper it s an awesome match no the shit s all wack cause youtube distort the facts i seen your battles and in real life you re a bit taller pat on camera that s gonna look awkward fam fuck yeah i ll still stretch that body out like a torture rack and i wonder what sort of pat are we gettin for our bucks i mean it s hard to tell which version will definitely come that s why i had a nightmare just preppin for the cunt he brings more characters to the table than eddie did to klumps we might be gettin that swagged out majestic pat we flex his hat direction back cool as an electric fan or it might be that sad and dejected man that manic depressive mad introspective pat that ll fuck off his third round and just confessing his regrets and that i m waitin listenin like it s a rap battle you re somewhat lackin in perspective pat or it might be that shouty pat mouthy twat peep a rhyme scheme and try to squeeze the life clean outta that lively rap about the fact he hate me and he s proud of that and how the man will mount attacks palm the axe a thousand stabs he ll around and pound my abs in the front out the back the crowd react lively clap and then he ll switch the shit calm down and relax he licks his lips and then goes into his clownin act well fuck it you can bring em all out to scrap you get x d after they name like malcolm had before he went to mecca and became malik el shabazz you see man s stock drop quicker than brexit cause the pound collapsed and it ain t cause i get the benefit at home like they housed me in a council flat it s cause when i serve a sentence i land with bars like alcatraz these straight lines through these rounds like an abacus you can count on that since i m showin them how you rap exposin ya action there s one constant from your openin chapters til it s closing it factors whether emotional matters or that boasty fuckin bully mode is your tactics or you just relax jokey relax shit it s still the same flow when he raps it so if you think you quotin the patrick just exposin his habits of bein overly active and usin multisyllabic but see tony can match it it s not tone kickin wack shit but i hope you got some tricks up your sleeve boy i hope you know magic you might also like round pat stay yo you look like an old wise chihuahua with a face that says why d you abandon me ll cool stay that s why i lick my lips drastically now tony s short for anthony but his last name s hamlet so the fact that he randomly adds the d is a little pamflit y i ll whoop his whole family molly whop mom and pop backhand his niece body slam anthony and give his aunt the knee grand theft auto shit rob his whip tell him hand the keys there s children around just get out the car mellow carmelo anthony i can t believe you thought you could fuck with pat i ain t playin no games with you like you button mash wanna battle i m at your door minute fuckin flat you ain t gotta ask axe like an unprepared lumberjack aye fam england where the fuck you at i already finished t tea where my crumpets at aye let s get drunk i need a shot to make me stumble back like ya boy when real deal whooped his fuckin ass there s a video of a horse fuckin a man to death on youtube on a sidebar the first suggested video is you two i was there crickets the entire way through at one point at one round one guy went sighs whoo i think nah i just crack a few jokes wit him butter up this little fuckin butter up this little fuckin english muffin then start toastin him i football kick to tony s adam s apple will start chokin him kinda like that time when you hahaha nah i ll stop roastin him look i m pokin him wrong end of the knife but it still goes through him blunt force trauma like snoop dogg made you smoke wit him release the ghost in him then start swingin on both of em people at a loss for words like look he mad right now he wants to choking sound gag right now he needs a fuckin glass of water so bad right now when i see anthony rap he was dazed and confused this pussy froze fros like s porn stars who didn t shave their pubes let s not beat around the bush i know exactly why you stumble bro expected that first punchline to hit then nothin though tried to recover back but all you could do was mumble though that s what he gets for talkin like everyone s under tone undertone and that day s traumatized him cause he called me out six months ago tried to set it up on king of the dot but he ducked it like a fuckin hoe uncle tone s scared to leave his comfort zone fuck it though think the game trouble you gon die in your little bubble bro see y all didn t even know that part dude s a jellyfish no spine and he don t have heart that s why i had to travel here to kill this old ass mark kimbo s first fight i came out and whooped him in his own backyard round tony d that was a hot round but somethin didn t really plan correct bruh how you seen a video of a horse fuckin a man to death so eurgh said th birthday pat stay s down said cool i ma put pat stay down and seriously make sure that pat stay down but it s funny my research game was brief first battle you vs hollohan displayed on my screen you used an angle had my interest blatantly peaked when you exposed his involvement in a basic and weak involved and promotion of the hatred that keeps the emotional focus of a racist belief it was deep and it fried my brain

nineteen fifty nine when the public was becoming aware of the muslims after the new york telecast the hate that hate produced i was in san francisco about to retire after twenty years in the u s coast guard a friend returned from a visit to her detroit home and told me of a startling black man s religion the nation of islam to which to her surprise her entire family was converted i listened with incredulity to how a mad scientist mr yacub had genetically grafted the white race from an original black people the organization s leader was described as the honorable elijah muhammad and a minister malcolm x was apparently chief of staff when i entered a civilian writing career in new york city i collected around harlem a good deal of provocative material and then proposed an article about the cult to the reader s digest visiting the muslim restaurant in harlem i asked how i could meet minister malcolm x who was pointed out talking in a telephone booth right behind me soon he came out a gangling tall reddish brown skinned fellow at that time thirty five years old when my purpose was made known he bristled his eyes skewering me from behind the horn rimmed glasses you re another one of the white man s tools sent to spy he accused me sharply i said i had a legitimate writing assignment and showed him my letter from the magazine stating that an objective article was wanted one that would balance what the muslims said of themselves and what their attackers said about them malcolm x snorted that no white man s promise was worth the paper it was on he would need time to decide if he would cooperate or not meanwhile he suggested that i could attend some of the harlem temple number meetings temples have since been renamed mosques which were open to non muslim negroes around the muslim s restaurant i met some of the converts all of them neatly dressed and almost embarrassingly polite their manners and miens reflected the spartan personal discipline the organization demanded and none of them would utter anything but nation of islam clich s even excellent weather was viewed as a blessing from allah with corollary credit due to the honorable elijah muhammad finally minister malcolm x told me that he would not take personal responsibility he said that i should talk about an article with mr muhammad personally i expressed willingness an appointment was made and i flew to chicago the slightly built shy acting soft voiced mr muhammad invited me to dinner with his immediate family in his mansion i was aware that i was being carefully sized up while he talked primarily of f b i and internal revenue service close surveillance of his organization and of a rumored forthcoming congressional probe but i have no fear of any of them i have all that i need the truth mr muhammad said the subject of my writing an article somehow never got raised but malcolm x proved far more cooperative when i returned he would sit with me at a white topped table in the muslim restaurant and answer guardedly any questions i asked between constant interruptions by calls from the new york press in the telephone booth when i asked if i could see muslim activities in some other cities he arranged with other ministers for me to attend meetings at temples in detroit washington and philadelphia my article entitled mr muhammad speaks appeared in early and it was the first featured magazine notice of the phenomenon a letter quickly came from mr muhammad appreciating that the article kept my promise to be objective and malcolm x telephoned similar compliments about this time dr c eric lincoln s book the black muslims in america was published and the black muslims became a subject of growing interest during and the saturday evening post teamed me with a white writer al balk to do an article next i did a personal interview of malcolm x for playboy magazine which had promised to print verbatim whatever response he made to my questions during that interview of several days duration malcolm x repeatedly exclaimed after particularly blistering anti christian or anti white statements you know that devil s not going to print that he was very much taken aback when playboy kept its word malcolm x began to warm up to me somewhat he was most aware of the national periodicals power and he had come to regard me if still suspiciously as one avenue of access occasionally now he began to telephone me advising me of some radio television or personal speaking appearance he was about to make or he would invite me to attend some black muslim bazaar or other public affair i was in this stage of relationship with the malcolm x who often described himself on the air as the angriest black man in america when in early my agent brought me together with a publisher whom the playboy interview had given the idea of the autobiography of malcolm x i was asked if i felt i could get the now nationally known firebrand to consent to telling the intimate details of his entire life i said i didn t know but i would ask him the editor asked me if i could sketch the likely highlights of such a book and as i commenced talking i realized how little i knew about the man personally despite all my interviews i said that the question had made me aware of how careful malcolm x had always been to play himself down and to play up his leader elijah muhammad all that i knew really i said was that i had heard malcolm x refer in passing to his life of crime and prison before he became a black muslim that several times he had told me you wouldn t believe my past and that i had heard others say that at one time he had peddled dope and women and committed armed robberies i knew that malcolm x had an almost fanatical obsession about time i have less patience with someone who doesn t wear a watch than with anyone else for this type is not time conscious he had once told me in all our deeds the proper value and respect for time determines success or failure i knew how the black muslim membership was said to increase wherever malcolm x lectured and i knew his pride that negro prisoners in most prisons were discovering the muslim religion as he had when he was a convict i knew he professed to eat only what a black muslim preferably his wife betty had cooked and he drank innumerable cups of coffee which he lightened with cream commenting wryly coffee is the only thing i like integrated over our luncheon table i told the editor and my agent how malcolm x could unsettle non muslims as for instance once when he offered to drive me to a subway i began to light a cigarette and he drily observed that would make you the first person ever to smoke in this automobile malcolm x gave me a startled look when i asked him if he would tell his life story for publication it was one of the few times i have ever seen him uncertain i will have to give a book a lot of thought he finally said two days later he telephoned me to meet him again at the black muslim restaurant he said i ll agree i think my life story may help people to appreciate better how mr muhammad salvages black people but i don t want my motives for this misinterpreted by anybody the nation of islam must get every penny that might come to me of course mr muhammad s agreement would be necessary and i would have to ask mr muhammad myself so i flew again to see mr muhammad but this time to phoenix arizona where the nation of islam had bought him the house in the hot dry climate that relieved his severe bronchial condition he and i talked alone this time he told me how his organization had come far with largely uneducated muslims and that truly giant strides for the black man could be made if his organization were aided by some of the talents which were available in the black race he said and one of our worst needs is writers but he did not press me to answer he suddenly began coughing and rapidly grew worse and worse until i rose from my seat and went to him alarmed but he waved me away gasping that he would be all right between gasps he told me he felt that allah approves the book he said malcolm is one of my most outstanding ministers after arranging for his chauffeur to return me to the phoenix airport mr muhammad quickly bade me good bye and rushed from the room coughing back east malcolm x carefully read and then signed the publication contract and he withdrew from his wallet a piece of paper filled with his sprawling longhand this is this book s dedication he said i read this book i dedicate to the honorable elijah muhammad who found me here in america in the muck and mire of the filthiest civilization and society on this earth and pulled me out cleaned me up and stood me on my feet and made me the man that i am today the contract provided that all monies accruing to malcolm x shall be made payable by the agent to muhammad s mosque no but malcolm x felt this was insufficient he dictated to me a letter to type for his signature which i did any and all monies representing my contracted share of the financial returns should be made payable by the literary agent to muhammad s mosque no these payments should be mailed to the following address mr raymond sharrieff woodlawn avenue chicago illinois another letter was dictated this one an agreement between him and me nothing can be in this book s manuscript that i didn t say and nothing can be left out that i want in it in turn i asked malcolm x to sign for me a personal pledge that however busy he was he would give me a priority quota of his time for the planned word as told to book which would detail his entire life and months later in a time of strain between us i asked for and he gave his permission that at the end of the book i could write comments of my own about him which would not be subject to his review malcolm x promptly did begin to pay me two and three hour visits parking his blue oldsmobile outside the working studio i then had in greenwich village he always arrived around nine or ten at night carrying his flat tan leather briefcase which along with his scholarly look gave him a resemblance to a hardworking lawyer inevitably he was tired after his long busy day and sometimes he was clearly exhausted we got off to a very poor start to use a word he liked i think both of us were a bit spooky sitting right there and staring at me was the fiery malcolm x who could be as acid toward negroes who angered him as he was against whites in general on television in press conferences and at muslim rallies i had heard him bitterly attack other negro writers as uncle toms yard negroes black men in white clothes and there i sat staring at him proposing to spend a year plumbing his innermost secrets when he had developed a near phobia for secrecy during his years of crime and his years in the muslim hierarchy my twenty years in military service and my christian religious persuasion didn t help either he often jeered publicly at these affiliations for negroes and although he now would indirectly urge me to write for national magazines about the muslims he had told me several times in various ways that you blacks with professional abilities of any kind will one of these days wake up and find out that you must unite under the leadership of the honorable elijah muhammad for your own salvation malcolm x was also convinced that the f b i had bugged my studio he probably suspected that it may even have been done with my cooperation for the first several weeks he never entered the room where we worked without exclaiming testing testing one two three tense incidents occurred one night a white friend was in the studio when malcolm x arrived a little earlier than anticipated and they passed each other in the corridor malcolm x s manner during all of that session suggested that his worst doubts had been confirmed another time when malcolm x sat haranguing me about the glories of the muslim organization he was gesturing with his passport in his hand he saw that i was trying to read its perforated number and suddenly he thrust the passport toward me his neck flushed reddish get the number straight but it won t be anything the white devil doesn t already know he issued me the passport for perhaps a month i was afraid we weren t going to get any book malcolm x was still stiffly addressing me as sir and my notebook contained almost nothing but black muslim philosophy praise of mr muhammad and the evils of the white devil he would bristle when i tried to urge him that the proposed book was his life i was thinking that i might have to advise the publisher that i simply couldn t seem to get through to my subject when the first note of hope occurred i had noticed that while malcolm x was talking he often simultaneously scribbled with his red ink ball point pen on any handy paper sometimes it was the margin of a newspaper he brought in sometimes it was on index cards that he carried in the back of a small redbacked appointment book i began leaving two white paper napkins by him every time i served him more coffee and the ruse worked when he sometimes scribbled on the napkins which i retrieved when he left some examples are these here lies a ym killed by a bm fighting for the wm who killed all the rm decoding that wasn t difficult knowing malcolm x ym was for yellow man bm for black man wm for white man and rm was for red man nothing ever happened without cause cause bm condition wm won t face wm obsessed with hiding his guilt if christianity had asserted itself in germany six million jews would have lived wm so quick to tell bm look what i have done for you no look what you have done to us bm dealing with wm who put our eyes out now he condemns us because we cannot see only persons really changed history those who changed men s thinking about themselves hitler as well as jesus stalin as well as buddha hon elijah muhammad it was through a clue from one of the scribblings that finally i cast a bait that malcolm x took woman who cries all the time is only because she knows she can get away with it he had scribbled i somehow raised the subject of women suddenly between sips of coffee and further scribbling and doodling he vented his criticisms and skepticisms of women you never can fully trust any woman he said i ve got the only one i ever met whom i would trust seventy five percent i ve told her that he said i ve told her like i tell you i ve seen too many men destroyed by their wives or their women i don t completely trust anyone he went on not even myself i have seen too many men destroy themselves other people i trust from not at all to highly like the honorable elijah muhammad malcolm x looked squarely at me you i trust about twenty five percent trying to keep malcolm x talking i mined the woman theme for all it was worth triumphantly he exclaimed do you know why benedict arnold turned traitor a woman he said whatever else a woman is i don t care who the woman is it starts with her being vain i ll prove it something you can do anytime you want and i know what i m talking about i ve done it you think of the hardest looking meanest acting woman you know one of those women who never smiles well every day you see that woman you look her right in the eyes and tell her i think you re beautiful and you watch what happens the first day she may curse you out the second day too but you watch you keep on after a while one day she s going to start smiling just as soon as you come in sight when malcolm x left that night i retrieved napkin scribblings that further documented how he could be talking about one thing and thinking of something else negroes have too much righteousness wm says i want this piece of land how do i get those couple of thousand bm on it off i have wife who understands or even if she doesn t she at least pretends bm struggle never gets open support from abroad it needs unless bm first forms own united front sit down talk with people with brains i respect all of us want same thing do some brainstorming would be shocking to reveal names of the bm leaders who have secretly met with them the capitalized letters stood for the honorable elijah muhammad then one night malcolm x arrived nearly out on his feet from fatigue for two hours he paced the floor delivering a tirade against negro leaders who were attacking elijah muhammad and himself i don t know what gave me the inspiration to say once when he paused for breath i wonder if you d tell me something about your mother abruptly he quit pacing and the look he shot at me made me sense that somehow the chance question had hit him when i look back at it now i believe i must have caught him so physically weak that his defenses were vulnerable slowly malcolm x began to talk now walking in a tight circle she was always standing over the stove trying to stretch whatever we had to eat we stayed so hungry that we were dizzy i remember the color of dresses she used to wear they were a kind of faded out gray and he kept on talking until dawn so tired that the big feet would often almost stumble in their pacing from this stream of consciousness reminiscing i finally got out of him the foundation for this book s beginning chapters nightmare and mascot after that night he never again hesitated to tell me even the most intimate details of his personal life over the next two years his talking about his mother triggered something malcolm x s mood ranged from somber to grim as he recalled his childhood i remember his making a great point of how he learned what had been a cardinal awareness of his ever since it s the hinge that squeaks that gets the grease when his narration reached his moving to boston to live with his half sister ella malcolm x began to laugh about how square he had been in the ghetto streets why i m telling you things i haven t thought about since then he would exclaim then it was during recalling the early harlem days that malcolm x really got carried away one night suddenly wildly he jumped up from his chair and incredibly the fearsome black demagogue was scat singing and popping his fingers re bop de bop blap blam and then grabbing a vertical pipe with one hand as the girl partner he went jubilantly lindy hopping around his coattail and the long legs and the big feet flying as they had in those harlem days and then almost as suddenly malcolm x caught himself and sat back down and for the rest of that session he was decidedly grumpy later on in the harlem narrative he grew somber again the only thing i considered wrong was what i got caught doing wrong i had a jungle mind i was living in a jungle and everything i did was done by instinct to survive but he stressed that he had no regrets about his crimes because it was all a result of what happens to thousands upon thousands of black men in the white man s christian world his enjoyment resumed when the narrative entered his prison days let me tell you how i d get those white devil convicts and the guards too to do anything i wanted i d whisper to them if you don t i ll start a rumor that you re really a light negro just passing as white that shows you what the white devil thinks about the black man he d rather die than be thought a negro he told me about the reading he had been able to do in prison i didn t know what i was doing but just by instinct i liked the books with intellectual vitamins and another time in the hectic pace of the world today there is no time for meditation or for deep thought a prisoner has time that he can put to good use i d put prison second to college as the best place for a man to go if he needs to do some thinking if he s motivated in prison he can change his life yet another time malcolm x reflected once a man has been to prison he never looks at himself or at other people the same again the squares out here whose boat has been in smooth waters all the time turn up their noses at an ex con but an ex con can keep his head up when the squares sink he scribbled that night i kept both my notebooks and the paper napkins dated this wm created and dropped a bomb on non whites wm now calls red and lives in fear of other wm he knows may bomb us also learn wisdom from the pupil of the eye that looks upon all things and yet to self is blind persian poet at intervals malcolm x would make a great point of stressing to me now i don t want anything in this book to make it sound that i think i m somebody important i would assure him that i would try not to and that in any event he would be checking the manuscript page by page and ultimately the galley proofs at other times he would end an attack upon the white man and watching me take the notes exclaim that devil s not going to print that i don t care what he says i would point out that the publishers had made a binding contract and had paid a sizable sum in advance malcolm x would say you trust them and i don t you studied what he wanted you to learn about him in schools i studied him in the streets and in prison where you see the truth experiences which malcolm x had had during a day could flavor his interview mood the most wistful tender anecdotes generally were told on days when some incident had touched him once for instance he told me that he had learned that a harlem couple not black muslims had named their newborn son malcolm after him what do you know about that he kept exclaiming and that was the night he went back to his own boyhood again and this time recalled how he used to lie on his back on hector s hill and think that night too i ll never forget the day they elected me the class president a girl named audrey slaugh whose father owned a car repair shop nominated me and a boy named james cotton seconded the nomination the teacher asked me to leave the room while the class voted when i returned i was the class president i couldn t believe it any interesting book which malcolm x had read could get him going about his love of books people don t realize how a man s whole life can be changed by one book he came back again and again to the books that he had studied when in prison did you ever read the loom of language he asked me and i said i hadn t you should philology it s a tough science all about how words can be recognized no matter where you find them now you take caesar it s latin in latin it s pronounced like kaiser with a hard c but we anglicize it by pronouncing a soft c the russians say czar and mean the same thing another russian dialect says tsar jakob grimm was one of the foremost philologists i studied his grimm s law in prison all about consonants philology is related to the science of etymology dealing in root words i dabbled in both of them when i turn that page in my notebook the next bears a note that malcolm x had telephoned me saying i m going to be out of town for a few days i assumed that as had frequently been the case before he had speaking engagements or other muslim business to attend somewhere and i was glad for the respite in which to get my notes separated under the chapter headings they would fit but when malcolm x returned this time he reported triumphantly i have something to tell you that will surprise you ever since we discussed my mother i ve been thinking about her i realized that i had blocked her out of my mind it was just unpleasant to think about her having been twenty some years in that mental hospital he said i don t want to take the credit it was really my sister yvonne who thought it might be possible to get her out yvonne got my brothers wilfred wesley and philbert together and i went out there too it was philbert who really handled it it made me face something about myself malcolm x said my mind had closed about our mother i simply didn t feel the problem could be solved so i had shut it out i had built up subconscious defenses the white man does this he shuts out of his mind and he builds up subconscious defenses against anything he doesn t want to face up to i ve just become aware how closed my mind was now that i ve opened it up again that s one of the characteristics i don t like about myself if i meet a problem i feel i can t solve i shut it out i make believe that it doesn t exist but it exists it was my turn to be deeply touched not long afterward he was again away for a few days when he returned this time he said that at his brother philbert s home we had dinner with our mother for the first time in all those years he said she s sixty six and her memory is better than mine and she looks young and healthy she has more of her teeth than those who were instrumental in sending her to the institution when something had angered malcolm x during the day his face would be flushed redder when he visited me and he generally would spend much of the session lashing out bitterly when some muslims were shot by los angeles policemen one of them being killed malcolm x upon his return from a trip he made there was fairly apoplectic for a week it had been in this mood that he had made in los angeles the statement which caused him to be heavily censured by members of both races i ve just heard some good news referring to a plane crash at orly field in paris in which thirty odd white americans mostly from atlanta georgia had been killed instantly malcolm x never publicly recanted this statement to my knowledge but much later he said to me simply that s one of the things i wish i had never said anytime the name of the present federal judge thurgood marshall was raised malcolm x still practically spat fire in memory of what the judge had said years before when he was the n a a c p chief attorney the muslims are run by a bunch of thugs organized from prisons and jails and financed i am sure by some arab group the only time that i have ever heard malcolm x use what might be construed as a curse word it was a hell used in response to a statement that dr martin luther king made that malcolm x s talk brought misery upon negroes malcolm x exploded to me how in the hell can my talk do this it s always a negro responsible not what the white man does the extremist or demagogue accusation invariably would burn malcolm x yes i m an extremist the black race here in north america is in extremely bad condition you show me a black man who isn t an extremist and i ll show you one who needs psychiatric attention once when he said aristotle shocked people charles darwin outraged people aldous huxley scandalized millions malcolm x immediately followed the statement with don t print that people would think i m trying to link myself with them another time when something provoked him to exclaim these uncle toms make me think about how the prophet jesus was criticized in his own country malcolm x promptly got up and silently took my notebook tore out that page and crumpled it and put it into his pocket and he was considerably subdued during the remainder of that session i remember one time we talked and he showed me a newspaper clipping reporting where a negro baby had been bitten by a rat malcolm x said now just read that just think of that a minute suppose it was your child where s that slumlord on some beach in miami he continued fuming throughout our interview i did not go with him when later that day he addressed a negro audience in harlem and an incident occurred which helen dudar reported in the new york post malcolm speaking in harlem stared down at one of the white reporters present the only whites admitted to the meeting and went on now there s a reporter who hasn t taken a note in half an hour but as soon as i start talking about the jews he s busy taking notes to prove that i m anti semitic behind the reporter a male voice spoke up kill the bastard kill them all the young man in his unease smiled nervously and malcolm jeered look at him laugh he s really not laughing he s just laughing with his teeth an ugly tension curled the edges of the atmosphere then malcolm went on the white man doesn t know how to laugh he just shows his teeth but we know how to laugh we laugh deep down from the bottom up the audience laughed deep down from the bottom up and as suddenly as malcolm had stirred it so skillfully and swiftly he deflected it it had been at once a masterful and shabby performance i later heard somewhere or read that malcolm x telephoned an apology to the reporter but this was the kind of evidence which caused many close observers of the malcolm x phenomenon to declare in absolute seriousness that he was the only negro in america who could either start a race riot or stop one when i once quoted this to him tacitly inviting his comment he told me tartly i don t know if i could start one i don t know if i d want to stop one it was the kind of statement he relished making over the months i had gradually come to establish something of a telephone acquaintance with malcolm x s wife whom i addressed as sister betty as i had heard the muslims do i admired how she ran a home with then three small daughters and still managed to take all of the calls which came for malcolm x surely as many calls as would provide a job for an average switchboard operator sometimes when he was with me he would telephone home and spend as much as five minutes rapidly jotting on a pad the various messages which had been left for him sister betty generally friendly enough on the phone with me sometimes would exclaim in spontaneous indignation the man never gets any sleep malcolm x rarely put in less than an eighteen hour workday often when he had left my studio at four a m and a forty minute drive lay between him and home in east elmhurst long island he had asked me to telephone him there at nine a m usually this would be when he wanted me to accompany him somewhere and he was going to tell me after reviewing his commitments when and where he wanted me to meet him there were times when i didn t get an awful lot of sleep myself he was always accompanied either by some of his muslim colleagues like james x the th man named james who had joined harlem s mosque number or charles x or by me but he never asked me to be with him when they were i went with him to college and university lectures to radio and television stations for his broadcasts and to public appearances in a variety of situations and locations if we were driving somewhere motorists along the highway would wave to malcolm x the faces of both whites and negroes spontaneously aglow with the wonderment that i had seen evoked by other celebrities no few airline hostesses had come to know him because he flew so much they smiled prettily at him he was in turn the essence of courtly gentlemanliness and inevitably the word spread and soon an unusual flow of bathroom traffic would develop passing where he sat whenever we arrived at our destination it became familiar to hear there s malcolm x where the tall one passers by of both races stared at him a few of both races more negroes than whites would speak or nod to him in greeting a high percentage of white people were visibly uncomfortable in his presence especially within the confines of small areas such as in elevators i m the only black man they ve ever been close to who they know speaks the truth to them malcolm x once explained to me it s their guilt that upsets them not me he said another time the white man is afraid of truth the truth takes the white man s breath and drains his strength you just watch his face get red anytime you tell him a little truth there was something about this man when he was in a room with people he commanded the room whoever else was present even out of doors once i remember in harlem he sat on a speaker s stand between congressman adam clayton powell and the former manhattan borough president hulan jack and when the street rally was over the crowd focus was chiefly on malcolm x i remember another time that we had gone by railway from new york city to philadelphia where he appeared in the philadelphia convention hall on the radio station wcau program of ed harvey you are the man who has said all negroes are angry and i am the angriest of all is that correct asked harvey on the air introducing malcolm x and as malcolm x said crisply that quote is correct the gathering crowd of bystanders stared at him riveted we had ridden to philadelphia in reserved parlor car seats i can t get caught on a coach i could get into trouble on a coach malcolm x had said walking to board the parlor car we had passed a dining car toward which he jerked his head i used to work on that thing riding to our destination he conversationally told me that the f b i had tried to bribe him for information about elijah muhammad that he wanted me to be sure and read a new book crisis in black and white by charles silberman one of the very few white writers i know with the

MI",spotify:track:6qbww64c7KFuVczzkS9TcC, contributorsromola chap lyricsthe peasants fair the moving crowd and the strange mixture of noises that burst on him at the entrance of the piazza reminded tito of what nello had said to him about the fierucoloni and he pushed his way into the crowd with a sort of pleasure in the hooting and elbowing which filled the empty moments and dulled that calculation of the future which had so new a dreariness for him as he foresaw himself wandering away solitary in pursuit of some unknown fortune that his thought had even glanced towards going in search of baldassarre after all at each of the opposite inlets he saw people struggling into the piazza while above them paper lanterns held aloft on sticks were waving uncertainly to and fro a rude monotonous chant made a distinctly traceable strand of noise across which screams whistles gibing chants in piping boyish voices the beating of drums and the ringing of little bells met each other in confused din every now and then one of the dim floating lights disappeared with a smash from a stone launched more or less vaguely in pursuit of mischief followed by a scream and renewed shouts but on the outskirts of the whirling tumult there were groups who were keeping this vigil of the nativity of the virgin in a more methodical manner than by fitful stone throwing and gibing certain ragged men darting a hard sharp glance around them while their tongues rattled merrily were inviting country people to game with them on fair and open handed terms two masquerading figures on stilts who had snatched lanterns from the crowd were swaying the lights to and fro in meteoric fashion as they strode hither and thither a sage trader was doing a profitable business at a small covered stall in hot berlingozzi a favourite farinaceous delicacy one man standing on a barrel with his back firmly planted against a pillar of the loggia in front of the foundling hospital spedale degl innocenti was selling efficacious pills invented by a doctor of salerno warranted to prevent toothache and death by drowning and not far off against another pillar a tumbler was showing off his tricks on a small platform while a handful of prentices despising the slack entertainment of guerilla stone throwing were having a private concentrated match of that favourite florentine sport at the narrow entrance of the via de febbrai tito obliged to make his way through chance openings in the crowd found himself at one moment close to the trotting procession of barefooted hard heeled contadine and could see their sun dried bronzed faces and their strange fragmentary garb dim with hereditary dirt and of obsolete stuffs and fashions that made them look in the eyes of the city people like a way worn ancestry returning from a pilgrimage on which they had set out a century ago just then it was the hardy scant feeding peasant women from the mountains of pistoia who wore entering with a year s labour in a moderate bundle of yarn on their backs and in their hearts that meagre hope of good and that wide dim fear of harm which were somehow to be cared for by the blessed virgin whose miraculous image painted by the angels was to have the curtain drawn away from it on this eve of her nativity that its potency might stream forth without obstruction at another moment he was forced away towards the boundary of the piazza where the more stationary candidates for attention and small coin had judiciously placed themselves in order to be safe in their rear among these tito recognised his acquaintance bratti who stood with his back against a pillar and his mouth pursed up in disdainful silence eyeing every one who approached him with a cold glance of superiority and keeping his hand fast on a serge covering which concealed the contents of the basket slung before him rather surprised at a deportment so unusual in an anxious trader tito went nearer and saw two women go up to bratti s basket with a look of curiosity whereupon the pedlar drew the covering tighter and looked another way it was quite too provoking and one of the women was fain to ask what there was in his basket before i answer that monna i must know whether you mean to buy i can t show such wares as mine in this fair for every fly to settle on and pay nothing my goods are a little too choice for that besides i ve only two left and i ve no mind to soil them for with the chances of the pestilence that wise men talk of there is likelihood of their being worth their weight in gold no no andate con dio the two women looked at each other and what may be the price said the second not within what you are likely to have in your purse buona donna said bratti in a compassionately supercilious tone i recommend you to trust in messer domeneddio and the saints poor people can do no better for themselves not so poor said the second woman indignantly drawing out her money bag come now what do you say to a grosso i say you may get twenty one quattrini for it said bratti coolly but not of me for i haven t got that small change come two then said the woman getting exasperated while her companion looked at her with some envy it will hardly be above two i think after further bidding and further mercantile coquetry bratti put on an air of concession since you ve set your mind on it he said slowly raising the cover i should be loth to do you a mischief for maestro gabbadeo used to say when a woman sets her mind on a thing and doesn t get it she s in worse danger of the pestilence than before ecco i have but two left and let me tell you the fellow to them is on the finger of maestro gabbadeo who is gone to bologna as wise a doctor as sits at any door the precious objects were two clumsy iron rings beaten into the fashion of old roman rings such as were sometimes disinterred the rust on them and the entirely hidden character of their potency were so satisfactory that the grossi were paid without grumbling and the first woman destitute of those handsome coins succeeded after much show of reluctance on bratti s part in driving a bargain with some of her yarn and carried off the remaining ring in triumph bratti covered up his basket which was now filled with miscellanies probably obtained under the same sort of circumstances as the yarn and moving from his pillar came suddenly upon tito who if he had had time would have chosen to avoid recognition by the head of san giovanni now said bratti drawing tito back to the pillar this is a piece of luck for i was talking of you this morning messer greco but i said he is mounted up among the signori now and i m glad of it for i was at the bottom of his fortune but i can rarely get speech of him for he s not to be caught lying on the stones now not he but it s your luck not mine messer greco save and except some small trifle to satisfy me for my trouble in the transaction you speak in riddles bratti said tito remember i don t sharpen my wits as you do by driving hard bargains for iron rings you must be plain by the holy vangels it was an easy bargain i gave them if a hebrew gets thirty two per cent i hope a christian may get a little more if i had not borne a conscience i should have got twice the money and twice the yarn but talking of rings it is your ring that very ring you ve got on your finger that i could get you a purchaser for ay and a purchaser with a deep money bag truly said tito looking at his ring and listening a genoese who is going straight away into hungary as i understand he came and looked all over my shop to see if i had any old things i didn t know the price of i warrant you he thought i had a pumpkin on my shoulders he had been rummaging all the shops in florence and he had a ring on not like yours but something of the same fashion and as he was talking of rings i said i knew a fine young man a particular acquaintance of mine who had a ring of that sort and he said who is he pray tell him i ll give him his price for it and i thought of going after you to nello s to morrow for it s my opinion of you messer greco that you re not one who d see the arno run broth and stand by without dipping your finger tito had lost no word of what bratti had said yet his mind had been very busy all the while why should he keep the ring it had been a mere sentiment a mere fancy that had prevented him from selling it with the other gems if he had been wiser and had sold it he might perhaps have escaped that identification by fra luca it was true that it had been taken from baldassarre s finger and put on his own as soon as his young hand had grown to the needful size but there was really no valid good to anybody in those superstitious scruples about inanimate objects the ring had helped towards the recognition of him tito had begun to dislike recognition which was a claim from the past this foreigner s offer if he would really give a good price was an opportunity for getting rid of the ring without the trouble of seeking a purchaser you speak with your usual wisdom bratti said tito i have no objection to hear what your genoese will offer but when and where shall i have speech of him to morrow at three hours after sunrise he will be at my shop and if your wits are of that sharpness i have always taken them to be messer greco you will ask him a heavy price for he minds not money it s my belief he s buying for somebody else and not for himself perhaps for some great signor it is well said tito i will be at your shop if nothing hinders and you will doubtless deal nobly by me for old acquaintance sake messer greco so i will not stay to fix the small sum you will give me in token of my service in the matter it seems to me a thousand years now till i get out of the piazza for a fair is a dull not to say a wicked thing when one has no more goods to sell tito made a hasty sign of assent and adieu and moving away from the pillar again found himself pushed towards the middle of the piazza and back again without the power of determining his own course in this zigzag way he was earned along to the end of the piazza opposite the church where in a deep recess formed by an irregularity in the line of houses an entertainment was going forward which seemed to be especially attractive to the crowd loud bursts of laughter interrupted a monologue which was sometimes slow and oratorical at others rattling and buffoonish here a girl was being pushed forward into the inner circle with apparent reluctance and there a loud laughing minx was finding a way with her own elbows it was a strange light that was spread over the piazza there were the pale stars breaking out above and the dim waving lanterns below leaving all objects indistinct except when they were seen close under the fitfully moving lights but in this recess there was a stronger light against which the heads of the encircling spectators stood in dark relief as tito was gradually pushed towards them while above them rose the head of a man wearing a white mitre with yellow cabalistic figures upon it behold my children tito heard him saying behold your opportunity neglect not the holy sacrament of matrimony when it can be had for the small sum of a white quattrino the cheapest matrimony ever offered and dissolved by special bull beforehand at every man s own will and pleasure behold the bull here the speaker held up a piece of parchment with huge seals attached to it behold the indulgence granted by his holiness alexander the sixth who being newly elected pope for his peculiar piety intends to reform and purify the church and wisely begins by abolishing that priestly abuse which keeps too large a share of this privileged matrimony to the clergy and stints the laity spit once my sons and pay a white quattrino this is the whole and sole price of the indulgence the quattrino is the only difference the holy father allows to be put any longer between us and the clergy who spit and pay nothing tito thought he knew the voice which had a peculiarly sharp ring but the face was too much in shadow from the lights behind for him to be sure of the features stepping as near as he could he saw within the circle behind the speaker an altar like table raised on a small platform and covered with a red drapery stitched all over with yellow cabalistical figures half a dozen thin tapers burned at the back of this table which had a conjuring apparatus scattered over it a large open book in the centre and at one of the front angles a monkey fastened by a cord to a small ring and holding a small taper which in his incessant fidgety movements fell more or less aslant whilst an impish boy in a white surplice occupied himself chiefly in cuffing the monkey and adjusting the taper the man in the mitre also wore a surplice and over it a chasuble on which the signs of the zodiac were rudely marked in black upon a yellow ground tito was sure now that he recognised the sharp upward tending angles of the face under the mitre it was that of maestro vaiano the mountebank from whom he had rescued tessa pretty little tessa perhaps she too had come in among the troops of contadine come my maidens this is the time for the pretty who can have many chances and for the ill favoured who have few matrimony to be had hot eaten and done with as easily as berlingozzi and see here the conjuror held up a cluster of tiny bags to every bride i give a breve with a secret in it the secret alone worth the money you pay for the matrimony the secret how to no no i will not tell you what the secret is about and that makes it a double secret hang it round your neck if you like and never look at it i don t say that will not be the best for then you will see many things you don t expect though if you open it you may break your leg vero but you will know a secret something nobody knows but me and mark i give you the breve i don t sell it as many another holy man would the quattrino is for the matrimony and the breve you get for nothing ors giovanetti come like dutiful sons of the church and buy the indulgence of his holiness alexander the sixth this buffoonery just fitted the taste of the audience the fierucola was but a small occasion so the townsmen might be contented with jokes that were rather less indecent than those they were accustomed to hear at every carnival put into easy rhyme by the magnifico and his poetic satellites while the women over and above any relish of the fun really began to have an itch for the brevi several couples had already gone through the ceremony in which the conjuror s solemn gibberish and grimaces over the open book the antics of the monkey and even the preliminary spitting had called forth peals of laughter and now a well looking merry eyed youth of seventeen in a loose tunic and red cap pushed forward holding by the hand a plump brunette whose scanty ragged dress displayed her round arms and legs very picturesquely fetter us without delay maestro said the youth for i have got to take my bride home and paint her under the light of a lantern ha mariotto my son i commend your pious observance the conjuror was going on when a loud chattering behind warned him that an unpleasant crisis had arisen with his monkey the temper of that imperfect acolyth was a little tried by the over active discipline of his colleague in the surplice and a sudden cuff administered as his taper fell to a horizontal position caused him to leap back with a violence that proved too much for the slackened knot by which his cord was fastened his first leap was to the other end of the table from which position his remonstrances were so threatening that the imp in the surplice took up a wand by way of an equivalent threat whereupon the monkey leaped on to the head of a tall woman in the foreground dropping his taper by the way and chattering with increased emphasis from that eminence great was the screaming and confusion not a few of the spectators having a vague dread of the maestro s monkey as capable of more hidden mischief than mere teeth and claws could inflict and the conjuror himself was in some alarm lest any harm should happen to his familiar in the scuffle to seize the monkey s string tito got out of the circle and not caring to contend for his place again he allowed himself to be gradually pushed towards the church of the nunziata and to enter amongst the worshippers the brilliant illumination within seemed to press upon his eyes with palpable force after the pale scattered lights and broad shadows of the piazza and for the first minute or two he could see nothing distinctly that yellow splendour was in itself something supernatural and heavenly to many of the peasant women for whom half the sky was hidden by mountains and who went to bed in the twilight and the uninterrupted chant from the choir was repose to the ear after the hellish hubbub of the crowd outside gradually the scene became clearer though still there was a thin yellow haze from incense mingling with the breath of the multitude in a chapel on the left hand of the nave wreathed with silver lamps was seen unveiled the miraculous fresco of the annunciation which in tito s oblique view of it from the right hand side of the nave seemed dark with the excess of light around it the whole area of the great church was filled with peasant women some kneeling some standing the coarse bronzed skins and the dingy clothing of the rougher dwellers on the mountains contrasting with the softer lined faces and white or red head drapery of the well to do dwellers in the valley who were scattered in irregular groups and spreading high and far over the walls and ceiling there was another multitude also pressing close against each other that they might be nearer the potent virgin it was the crowd of votive waxen images the effigies of great personages clothed in their habit as they lived florentines of high name in their black silk lucco as when they sat in council popes emperors kings cardinals and famous condottieri with plumed morion seated on their chargers all notable strangers who passed through florence or had aught to do with its affairs mohammedans even in well tolerated companionship with christian cavaliers some of them with faces blackened and robes tattered by the corroding breath of centuries others fresh and bright in new red mantle or steel corselet the exact doubles of the living and wedged in with all these were detached arms legs and other members with only here and there a gap where some image had been removed for public disgrace or had fallen ominously as lorenzo s had done six months before it was a perfect resurrection swarm of remote mortals and fragments of mortals reflecting in their varying degrees of freshness the sombre dinginess and sprinkled brightness of the crowd below tito s glance wandered over the wild multitude in search of something he had already thought of tessa and the white hoods suggested the possibility that he might detect her face under one of them it was at least a thought to be courted rather than the vision of romola looking at him with changed eyes but he searched in vain and he was leaving the church weary of a scene which had no variety when just against the doorway he caught sight of tessa only two yards off him she was kneeling with her back against the wall behind a group of peasant women who were standing and looking for a spot nearer to the sacred image her head hung a little aside with a look of weariness and her blue eyes were directed rather absently towards an altar piece where the archangel michael stood in his armour with young face and floating hair amongst bearded and tonsured saints her right hand holding a bunch of cocoons fell by her side listlessly and her round cheek was paled either by the light or by the weariness that was expressed in her attitude her lips were pressed poutingly together and every now and then her eyelids half fell she was a large image of a sweet sleepy child tito felt an irresistible desire to go up to her and get her pretty trusting looks and prattle this creature who was without moral judgment that could condemn him whose little loving ignorant soul made a world apart where he might feel in freedom from suspicions and exacting demands had a new attraction for him now she seemed a refuge from the threatened isolation that would come with disgrace he glanced cautiously round to assure himself that monna ghita was not near and then slipping quietly to her side kneeled on one knee and said in the softest voice tessa she hardly started any more than she would have started at a soft breeze that fanned her gently when she was needing it she turned her head and saw tito s face close to her it was very much more beautiful than the archangel michael s who was so mighty and so good that he lived with the madonna and all the saints and was prayed to along with them she smiled in happy silence for that nearness of tito quite filled her mind my little tessa you look very tired how long have you been kneeling here she seemed to be collecting her thoughts for a minute or two and at last she said i m very hungry come then come with me he lifted her from her knees and led her out under the cloisters surrounding the atrium which were then open and not yet adorned with the frescoes of andrea del sarto how is it you are all by yourself and so hungry tessa the madre is ill she has very bad pains in her legs and sent me to bring these cocoons to the santissima nunziata because they re so wonderful see she held up the bunch of cocoons which were arranged with fortuitous regularity on a stem and she had kept them to bring them herself but she couldn t and so she sent me because she thinks the holy madonna may take away her pains and somebody took my bag with the bread and chestnuts in it and the people pushed me back and i was so frightened coming in the crowd and i couldn t get anywhere near the holy madonna to give the cocoons to the padre but i must oh i must yes my little tessa you shall take them but first come and let me give you some berlingozzi there are some to be had not far off where did you come from said tessa a little bewildered i thought you would never come to me again because you never came to the mercato for milk any more i set myself aves to say to see if they would bring you back but i left off because they didn t you see i come when you want some one to take care of you tessa perhaps the aves fetched me only it took them a long while but what shall you do if you are here all alone where shall you go oh i shall stay and sleep in the church a great many of them do in the church and all about here i did once when i came with my mother and the patrigno is coming with the mules in the morning they were out in the piazza now where the crowd was rather less riotous than before and the lights were fewer the stream of pilgrims having ceased tessa clung fast to tito s arm in satisfied silence while he led her towards the stall where he remembered seeing the eatables their way was the easier because there was just now a great rush towards the middle of the piazza where the masqued figures on stilts had found space to execute a dance it was very pretty to see the guileless thing giving her cocoons into tito s hand and then eating her berlingozzi with the relish of a hungry child tito had really come to take care of her as he did before and that wonderful happiness of being with him had begun again for her her hunger was soon appeased all the sooner for the new stimulus of happiness that had roused her from her languor and as they turned away from the stall she said nothing about going into the church again but looked round as if the sights in the piazza were not without attraction to her now she was safe under tito s arm how can they do that she exclaimed looking up at the dancers on stilts then after a minute s silence do you think saint christopher helps them perhaps what do you think about it tessa said tito slipping his right arm round her and looking down at her fondly because saint christopher is so very tall and he is very good if anybody looks at him he takes care of them all day he is on the wall of the church too tall to stand up there but i saw him walking through the streets one san giovanni carrying the little gesu you pretty pigeon do you think anybody could help taking care of you if you looked at them shall you always come and take care of me said tessa turning her face up to him as he crushed her cheek with his left hand and shall you always be a long while first tito was conscious that some bystanders were laughing at them and though the licence of street fun among artists and young men of the wealthier sort as well as among the populace made few adventures exceptional still less disreputable he chose to move away towards the end of the piazza perhaps i shall come again to you very soon tessa he answered rather dreamily when they had moved away he was thinking that when all the rest had turned their backs upon him it would be pleasant to have this little creature adoring him and nestling against him the absence of presumptuous self conceit in tito made him feel all the more defenceless under prospective obloquy he needed soft looks and caresses too much ever to be impudent in the mercato said tessa not to morrow morning because the patrigno will be there and he is so cross oh but you have money and he will not be cross if you buy some salad and there are some chestnuts do you like chestnuts he said nothing but continued to look down at her with a dreamy gentleness and tessa felt herself in a state of delicious wonder everything seemed as new as if she were being earned on a chariot of clouds holy virgin she exclaimed again presently there is a holy father like the bishop i saw at prato tito looked up too and saw that he had unconsciously advanced to within a few yards of the conjuror maestro vaiano who for the moment was forsaken by the crowd his face was turned away from them and he was occupied with the apparatus on his altar or table preparing a new diversion by the time the interest in the dancing should be exhausted the monkey was imprisoned under the red cloth out of reach of mischief and the youngster in the white surplice was holding a sort of dish or salver from which his master was taking some ingredient the altar like table with its gorgeous cloth the row of tapers the sham episcopal costume the surpliced attendant and even the movements of the mitred figure as he alternately bent his head and then raised something before the lights were a sufficiently near parody of sacred things to rouse poor little tessa s veneration and there was some additional awe produced by the mystery of their apparition in this spot for when she had seen an altar in the street before it had been on corpus christi day and there had been a procession to account for it she crossed herself and looked up at tito but then as if she had had time for reflection said it is because of the nativita meanwhile vaiano had turned round raising his hands to his mitre with the intention of changing his dress when his quick eye recognised tito and tessa who were both looking at him their faces being shone upon by the light of his tapers while his own was in shadow ha my children he said instantly stretching out his hands in a benedictory attitude you are come to be married i commend your penitence the blessing of holy church can never come too late but whilst he was speaking he had taken in the whole meaning of tessa s attitude and expression and he discerned an opportunity for a new kind of joke which required him to be cautious and solemn should you like to be married to me tessa said tito softly half enjoying the comedy as he saw the pretty childish seriousness on her face half prompted by hazy previsions which belonged to the intoxication of despair he felt her vibrating before she looked up at him and said timidly will you let me he answered only by a smile and by leading her forward in front of the cerretano who seeing an excellent jest in tessa s evident delusion assumed a surpassing sacerdotal solemnity and went through the mimic ceremony with a liberal expenditure of lingua furbesca or thieves latin but some symptoms of a new movement in the crowd urged him to bring it to a speedy conclusion and dismiss them with hands outstretched in a benedictory attitude over their kneeling figures tito disposed always to cultivate goodwill though it might be the least select put a piece of four grossi into his hand as he moved away and was thanked by a look which the conjuror felt sure conveyed a perfect understanding of the whole affair but tito himself was very far from that understanding and did not in fact know whether the next moment he should tell tessa of the joke and laugh at her for a little goose or whether he should let her delusion last and see what would come of it see what she would say and do next then you will not go away from me again said tessa after they had walked a few steps and you will take me to where you live she spoke meditatively and not in a questioning tone but presently she added i must go back once to the madre though to tell her i brought the cocoons and that i am married and shall not go back again tito felt the necessity of speaking now and in the rapid thought prompted by that necessity he saw that by undeceiving tessa he should be robbing himself of some at least of that pretty trustfulness which might by and by be his only haven from contempt it would spoil tessa to make her the least particle wiser or more suspicious yes my little tessa he said caressingly you must go back to the madre but you must not tell her you are married you must keep that a secret from everybody else some very great harm would happen to me and you would never see me again she looked up at him with fear in her face you must go back and feed your goats and mules and do just as you have always done before and say no word to any one about me the corners of her mouth fell a little and then perhaps i shall come and take care of you again when you want me as i did before but you must do just what i tell you else you will not see me again yes i will i will she said in a loud whisper frightened at that blank prospect they were silent a little while and then tessa looking at her hand said the madre wears a betrothal ring she went to church and had it put on and then after that an other day she was married and so did the cousin nannina but then she married gollo added the poor little thing entangled in the difficult comparison between her own ease and others within her experience but you must not wear a betrothal ring my tessa because no one must know you are married said tito feeling some insistance necessary and the buona fortuna that i gave you did just as well for betrothal some people are betrothed with rings and some are not yes it is true they would see the ring said tessa trying to convince herself that a thing she would like very much was really not good for her they were now near the entrance of the church again and she remembered her cocoons which were still in tito s hand ah you must give me the boto she said and we must go in and i must take it to the padre and i must tell the rest of my beads because i was too tired before yes you must go in tessa but i will not go in i must leave you now said tito too feverish and weary to re enter that stifling heat and feeling that this was the least difficult way of parting with her and not come back oh where do you go tessa s mind had never formed an image of his whereabout or his doings when she did not see him he had vanished and her thought instead of following him had stayed in the same spot where he was with her i shall come back some time tessa said tito taking her under the cloisters to the door of the church you must not cry you must go to sleep when you have said your beads and here is money to buy your breakfast now kiss me and look happy else i shall not come again she made a great effort over herself as she put up her lips to kiss him and submitted to be gently turned round with her face towards the door of the church tito saw her enter and then with a shrug at his own resolution leaned against a pillar took off his cap rubbed his hair backward and wondered where romola was now and what she was thinking of him poor little tessa had disappeared behind the curtain among the crowd of peasants but the love which formed one web with all his worldly hopes with the ambitions and pleasures that must make the solid part of his days the love that was identified with his larger self was not to be banished from his consciousness even to the man who presents the most elastic resistance to whatever is unpleasant there will come

acknowledgments this is a small hymn to an exaltation of women r lene dahlberg fanned the embers lisa schwarzbaum read early pages and encouraged me mary breasted smyth elegant novelist herself read the first third and passed it on to molly friedrich who became my agent and thought that nan graham editor in chief at scribner would be just the right person to put the book on the road and molly was right my daughter maggie has shown me how life can be a grand adventure while exquisite moments with my granddaughter chiara have helped me recall a small child s wonder my wife ellen listened while i read and cheered me to the final page i am blessed among men i my father and mother should have stayed in new york where they met and married and where i was born instead they returned to ireland when i was four my brother malachy three the twins oliver and eugene barely one and my sister margaret dead and gone when i look back on my childhood i wonder how i survived at all it was of course a miserable childhood the happy childhood is hardly worth your while worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable irish childhood and worse yet is the miserable irish catholic childhood people everywhere brag and whimper about the woes of their early years but nothing can compare with the irish version the poverty the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire pompous priests bullying schoolmasters the english and the terrible things they did to us for eight hundred long years above all we were wet out in the atlantic ocean great sheets of rain gathered to drift slowly up the river shannon and settle forever in limerick the rain dampened the city from the feast of the circumcision to new year s eve it created a cacophony of hacking coughs bronchial rattles asthmatic wheezes consumptive croaks it turned noses into fountains lungs into bacterial sponges it provoked cures galore to ease the catarrh you boiled onions in milk blackened with pepper for the congested passages you made a paste of boiled flour and nettles wrapped it in a rag and slapped it sizzling on the chest from october to april the walls of limerick glistened with the damp clothes never dried tweed and woolen coats housed living things sometimes sprouted mysterious vegetations in pubs steam rose from damp bodies and garments to be inhaled with cigarette and pipe smoke laced with the stale fumes of spilled stout and whiskey and tinged with the odor of piss wafting in from the outdoor jakes where many a man puked up his week s wages the rain drove us into the church our refuge our strength our only dry place at mass benediction novenas we huddled in great damp clumps dozing through priest drone while steam rose again from our clothes to mingle with the sweetness of incense flowers and candles limerick gained a reputation for piety but we knew it was only the rain my father malachy mccourt was born on a farm in toome county antrim like his father before he grew up wild in trouble with the english or the irish or both he fought with the old ira and for some desperate act he wound up a fugitive with a price on his head when i was a child i would look at my father the thinning hair the collapsing teeth and wonder why anyone would give money for a head like that when i was thirteen my father s mother told me a secret as a wee lad your poor father was dropped on his head it was an accident he was never the same after and you must remember that people dropped on their heads can be a bit peculiar because of the price on the head he had been dropped on he had to be spirited out of ireland via cargo ship from galway in new york with prohibition in full swing he thought he had died and gone to hell for his sins then he discovered speakeasies and he rejoiced after wandering and drinking in america and england he yearned for peace in his declining years he returned to belfast which erupted all around him he said a pox on all their houses and chatted with the ladies of andersontown they tempted him with delicacies but he waved them away and drank his tea he no longer smoked or touched alcohol so what was the use it was time to go and he died in the royal victoria hospital my mother the former angela sheehan grew up in a limerick slum with her mother two brothers thomas and patrick and a sister agnes she never saw her father who had run off to australia weeks before her birth after a night of drinking porter in the pubs of limerick he staggers down the lane singing his favorite song who threw the overalls in mrs murphy s chowder nobody spoke so he said it all the louder it s a dirty irish trick and i can lick the mick who threw the overalls in murphy s chowder he s in great form altogether and he thinks he ll play a while with little patrick one year old lovely little fella loves his daddy laughs when daddy throws him up in the air upsy daisy little paddy upsy daisy up in the air in the dark so dark oh jasus you miss the child on the way down and poor little patrick lands on his head gurgles a bit whimpers goes quiet grandma heaves herself from the bed heavy with the child in her belly my mother she s barely able to lift little patrick from the floor she moans a long moan over the child and turns on grandpa get out of it out if you stay here a minute longer i ll take the hatchet to you you drunken lunatic by jesus i ll swing at the end of a rope for you get out grandpa stands his ground like a man i have a right he says to stay in me own house she runs at him and he melts before this whirling dervish with a damaged child in her arms and a healthy one stirring inside he stumbles from the house up the lane and doesn t stop till he reaches melbourne in australia little pat my uncle was never the same after he grew up soft in the head with a left leg that went one way his body the other he never learned to read or write but god blessed him in another way when he started to sell newspapers at the age of eight he could count money better than the chancellor of the exchequer himself no one knew why he was called ab sheehan the abbot but all limerick loved him my mother s troubles began the night she was born there is my grandmother in the bed heaving and gasping with the labor pains praying to st gerard majella patron saint of expectant mothers there is nurse o halloran the midwife all dressed up in her finery it s new year s eve and mrs o halloran is anxious for this child to be born so that she can rush off to the parties and celebrations she tells my grandmother will you push will you push jesus mary and holy st joseph if you don t hurry with this child it won t be born till the new year and what good is that to me with me new dress never mind st gerard majella what can a man do for a woman at a time like this even if he is a saint st gerard majella my arse my grandmother switches her prayers to st ann patron saint of difficult labor but the child won t come nurse o halloran tells my grandmother pray to st jude patron saint of desperate cases st jude patron of desperate cases help me i m desperate she grunts and pushes and the infant s head appears only the head my mother and it s the stroke of midnight the new year limerick city erupts with whistles horns sirens brass bands people calling and singing happy new year should auld acquaintance be forgot and church bells all over ring out the angelus and nurse o halloran weeps for the waste of a dress that child still in there and me in me finery will you come out child will you grandma gives a great push and the child is in the world a lovely girl with black curly hair and sad blue eyes ah lord above says nurse o halloran this child is a time straddler born with her head in the new year and her arse in the old or was it her head in the old year and her arse in the new you ll have to write to the pope missus to find out what year this child was born in and i ll save this dress for next year and the child was named angela for the angelus which rang the midnight hour the new year the minute of her coming and because she was a little angel anyway love her as in childhood though feeble old and grey for you ll never miss a mother s love till she s buried beneath the clay at the st vincent de paul school angela learned to read write and calculate and by her ninth year her schooling was done she tried her hand at being a charwoman a skivvy a maid with a little white hat opening doors but she could not manage the little curtsy that is required and her mother said you don t have the knack of it you re pure useless why don t you go to america where there s room for all sorts of uselessness i ll give you the fare she arrived in new york just in time for the first thanksgiving day of the great depression she met malachy at a party given by dan macadorey and his wife minnie on classon avenue in brooklyn malachy liked angela and she liked him he had a hangdog look which came from the three months he had just spent in jail for hijacking a truck he and his friend john mcerlaine believed what they were told in the speakeasy that the truck was packed to the roof with cases of canned pork and beans neither knew how to drive and when the police saw the truck lurch and jerk along myrtle avenue they pulled it over the police searched the truck and wondered why anyone would hijack a truck containing not pork and beans but cases of buttons with angela drawn to the hangdog look and malachy lonely after three months in jail there was bound to be a knee trembler a knee trembler is the act itself done up against a wall man and woman up on their toes straining so hard their knees tremble with the excitement that s in it that knee trembler put angela in an interesting condition and of course there was talk angela had cousins the macnamara sisters delia and philomena married respectively to jimmy fortune of county mayo and tommy flynn of brooklyn itself delia and philomena were large women great breasted and fierce when they sailed along the sidewalks of brooklyn lesser creatures stepped aside respect was shown the sisters knew what was right and they knew what was wrong and any doubts could be resolved by the one holy roman catholic and apostolic church they knew that angela unmarried had no right to be in an interesting condition and they would take steps steps they took with jimmy and tommy in tow they marched to the speakeasy on atlantic avenue where malachy could be found on friday payday when he had a job the man in the speak joey cacciamani did not want to admit the sisters but philomena told him that if he wanted to keep the nose on his face and that door on its hinges he d better open up for they were there on god s business joey said awright awright you irish jeezoz trouble trouble malachy at the far end of the bar turned pale gave the great breasted ones a sickly smile offered them a drink they resisted the smile and spurned the offer delia said we don t know what class of a tribe you come from in the north of ireland philomena said there is a suspicion you might have presbyterians in your family which would explain what you did to our cousin jimmy said ah now ah now tisn t his fault if there s presbyterians in his family delia said you shuddup tommy had to join in what you did to that poor unfortunate girl is a disgrace to the irish race and you should be ashamed of yourself och i am said malachy i am nobody asked you to talk said philomena you done enough damage with your blather so shut your yap and while your yap is shut said delia we re here to see you do the right thing by our poor cousin angela sheehan malachy said och indeed indeed the right thing is the right thing and i d be glad to buy you all a drink while we have this little talk take the drink said tommy and shove it up your ass philomena said our little cousin no sooner gets off the boat than you are at her we have morals in limerick you know morals we re not like jackrabbits from antrim a place crawling with presbyterians jimmy said he don t look like a presbyterian you shuddup said delia another thing we noticed said philomena you have a very odd manner malachy smiled i do about you do says delia i think tis one of the first things we noticed you that odd manner and it gives us a very uneasy feeling tis that sneaky little presbyterian smile said philomena och said malachy it s just the trouble i have with my teeth teeth or no teeth odd manner or no odd manner you re gonna marry that girl said tommy up the middle aisle you re going och said malachy i wasn t planning to get married you know there s no work and i wouldn t be able to support married is what you re going to be said delia up the middle aisle said jimmy you shuddup said delia malachy watched them leave i m in a desperate pickle he told joey cacciamani bet your ass said joey i see them babes comin at me i jump inna hudson river malachy considered the pickle he was in he had a few dollars in his pocket from the last job and he had an uncle in san francisco or one of the other california sans wouldn t he be better off in california far from the great breasted macnamara sisters and their grim husbands he would indeed and he d have a drop of the irish to celebrate his decision and departure joey poured and the drink nearly took the lining off malachy s gullet irish indeed he told joey it was a prohibition concoction from the devil s own still joey shrugged i don t know nothing i only pour still it was better than nothing and malachy would have another and one for yourself joey and ask them two decent italians what they d like and what are you talking about of course i have the money to pay for it he awoke on a bench in the long island railroad station a cop rapping on his boots with a nightstick his escape money gone the macnamara sisters ready to eat him alive in brooklyn on the feast of st joseph a bitter day in march four months after the knee trembler malachy married angela and in august the child was born in november malachy got drunk and decided it was time to register the child s birth he thought he might name the child malachy after himself but his north of ireland accent and the alcoholic mumble confused the clerk so much he simply entered the name male on the certificate not until late december did they take male to st paul s church to be baptized and named francis after his father s father and the lovely saint of assisi angela wanted to give him a middle name munchin after the patron saint of limerick but malachy said over his dead body no son of his would have a limerick name it s hard enough going through life with one name sticking on middle names was an atrocious american habit and there was no need for a second name when you re christened after the man from assisi there was a delay the day of the baptism when the chosen godfather john mcerlaine got drunk at the speakeasy and forgot his responsibilities philomena told her husband tommy he d have to be godfather child s soul is in danger she said tommy put his head down and grumbled all right i ll be godfather but i m not goin to be responsible if he grows up like his father causin trouble and goin through life with the odd manner for if he does he can go to john mcerlaine at the speakeasy the priest said true for you tom decent man that you are fine man that never set foot inside a speakeasy malachy fresh from the speakeasy himself felt insulted and wanted to argue with the priest one sacrilege on top of another take off that collar and we ll see who s the man he had to be held back by the great breasted ones and their husbands grim angela new mother agitated forgot she was holding the child and let him slip into the baptismal font a total immersion of the protestant type the altar boy assisting the priest plucked the infant from the font and restored him to angela who sobbed and clutched him dripping to her bosom the priest laughed said he had never seen the likes that the child was a regular little baptist now and hardly needed a priest this maddened malachy again and he wanted to jump at the priest for calling the child some class of a protestant the priest said quiet man you re in god s house and when malachy said god s house my arse he was thrown out on court street because you can t say arse in god s house after baptism philomena said she had tea and ham and cakes in her house around the corner malachy said tea and she said yes tea or is it whiskey you want he said tea was grand but first he d have to go and deal with john mcerlaine who didn t have the decency to carry out his duties as godfather angela said you re only looking for an excuse to run to the speakeasy and he said as god is my witness the drink is the last thing on my mind angela started to cry your son s christening day and you have to go drinking delia told him he was a disgusting specimen but what could you expect from the north of ireland malachy looked from one to the other shifted on his feet pulled his cap down over his eyes shoved his hands deep in his trouser pockets said och aye the way they do in the far reaches of county antrim turned hurried up court street to the speakeasy on atlantic avenue where he was sure they d ply him with free drink in honor of his son s baptism at philomena s house the sisters and their husbands ate and drank while angela sat in a corner nursing the baby and crying philomena stuffed her mouth with bread and ham and rumbled at angela that s what you get for being such a fool hardly off the boat and you fall for that lunatic you shoulda stayed single put the child up for adoption and you d be a free woman today angela cried harder and delia took up the attack oh stop it angela stop it you have nobody to blame but yourself for gettin into trouble with a drunkard from the north a man that doesn t even look like a catholic him with his odd manner i d say that that malachy has a streak of the presbyterian in him right enough you shuddup jimmy if i was you said philomena i d make sure there s no more children he don t have a job so he don t an never will the way he drinks so no more children angela are you listenin to me i am philomena a year later another child was born angela called him malachy after his father and gave him a middle name gerard after his father s brother the macnamara sisters said angela was nothing but a rabbit and they wanted nothing to do with her till she came to her senses their husbands agreed i m in a playground on classon avenue in brooklyn with my brother malachy he s two i m three we re on the seesaw up down up down malachy goes up i get off malachy goes down seesaw hits the ground he screams his hand is on his mouth and there s blood oh god blood is bad my mother will kill me and here she is trying to run across the playground her big belly slows her she says what did you do what did you do to i don t know what to say i don t know what i she pulls my ear go home go to bed bed in the middle of the day she pushes me toward the playground gate go she picks up malachy and waddles off my father s friend mr macadorey is outside the child did our building he s standing at the edge of the sidewalk with his wife minnie looking at a dog lying in the gutter there is blood all around the dog s head it s the color of the blood from malachy s mouth malachy has dog blood and the dog has malachy blood i pull mr macadorey s hand i tell him malachy has blood like the dog oh he does indeed francis cats have it too and eskimos all the same blood minnie says stop that dan stop confusing the wee fellow she tells me the poor wee dog was hit by a car and he crawled all the way from the middle of the street before he died wanted to come home the poor wee creature mr macadorey says you d better go home francis i don t know what you did to your wee brother but your mother took him off to the hospital go home child will malachy die like the dog mr macadorey minnie says he bit his tongue he won t die why did the dog die it was his time francis the apartment is empty and i wander between the two rooms the bedroom and the kitchen my father is out looking for a job and my mother is at the hospital with malachy i wish i had something to eat but there s nothing in the icebox but cabbage leaves floating in the melted ice my father said never eat anything floating in water for the rot that might be in it i fall asleep on my parents bed and when my mother shakes me it s nearly dark your little brother is going to sleep a while nearly bit his tongue off stitches galore go into the other room my father is in the kitchen sipping black tea from his big white enamel mug he lifts me to his lap dad will you tell me the story about coo coo cuchulain say it after me coo hoo lin i ll tell you the story when you say the name right coo hoo lin i say it right and he tells me the story of cuchulain who had a different name when he was a boy setanta he grew up in ireland where dad lived when he was a boy in county antrim setanta had a stick and ball and one day he hit the ball and it went into the mouth of a big dog that belonged to culain and choked him oh culain was angry and he said what am i to do now without my big dog to guard my house and my wife and my ten small children as well as numerous pigs hens sheep setanta said i m sorry i ll guard your house with my stick and ball and i ll change my name to cuchulain the hound of culain he did he guarded the house and regions beyond and became a great hero the hound of ulster itself dad said he was a greater hero than hercules or achilles that the greeks were always bragging about and he could take on king arthur and all his knights in a fair fight which of course you could never get with an englishman anyway that s my story dad can t tell that story to malachy or any other children down the hall he finishes the story and lets me sip his tea it s bitter but i m happy there on his lap for days malachy s tongue is swollen and he can hardly make a sound never mind talk but even if he could no one is paying any attention to him because we have two new babies who were brought by an angel in the middle of the night the neighbors say ooh ah they re lovely boys look at those big eyes malachy stands in the middle of the room looking up at everyone pointing to his tongue and saying uck uck when the neighbors say can t you see we re looking at your little brothers he cries till dad pats him on the head put in your tongue son and go out and play with frankie go on in the playground i tell malachy about the dog who died in the street because someone drove a ball into his mouth malachy shakes his head no uck ball car uck kill dog he cries because his tongue hurts and he can hardly talk and it s terrible when you can t talk he won t let me push him on the swing he says you uck kill me uck on seesaw he gets freddie leibowitz to push him and he s happy laughing when he swings to the sky freddie is big he s seven and i ask him to push me he says no you tried to kill your brother i try to get the swing going myself but all i can do is move it back and forth and i m angry because freddie and malachy are laughing at the way i can t swing they re great pals now freddie seven malachy two they laugh every day and malachy s tongue gets better with all the laughing when he laughs you can see how white and small and pretty his teeth are and you can see his eyes shine he has blue eyes like my mother he has golden hair and pink cheeks i have brown eyes like dad i have black hair and my cheeks are white in the mirror my mother tells mrs leibowitz down the hall that malachy is the happiest child in the world she tells mrs leibowitz down the hall frankie has the odd manner like his father i wonder what the odd manner is but i can t ask because i m not supposed to be listening i wish i could swing up into the sky up into the clouds i might be able to fly around the whole world and not hear my brothers oliver and eugene cry in the middle of the night anymore my mother says they re always hungry she cries in the middle of the night too she says she s worn out nursing and feeding and changing and four boys is too much for her she wishes she had one little girl all for herself she d give anything for one little girl i m in the playground with malachy i m four he s three he lets me push him on the swing because he s no good at swinging himself and freddie leibowitz is in school we have to stay in the playground because the twins are sleeping and my mother says she s worn out go out and play she says and give me some rest dad is out looking for a job again and sometimes he comes home with the smell of whiskey singing all the songs about suffering ireland mam gets angry and says ireland can kiss her arse he says that s nice language to be using in front of the children and she says never mind the language food on the table is what she wants not suffering ireland she says it was a sad day prohibition ended because dad gets the drink going around to saloons offering to sweep out the bars and lift barrels for a whiskey or a beer sometimes he brings home bits of the free lunch rye bread corned beef pickles he puts the food on the table and drinks tea himself he says food is a shock to the system and he doesn t know where we get our appetites mam says they get their appetites because they re starving half the time when dad gets a job mam is cheerful and she sings anyone can see why i wanted your kiss it had to be and the reason is this could it be true someone like you could love me love me when dad brings home the first week s wages mam is delighted she can pay the lovely italian man in the grocery shop and she can hold her head up again because there s nothing worse in the world than to owe and be beholden to anyone she cleans the kitchen washes the mugs and plates brushes crumbs and bits of food from the table cleans out the icebox and orders a fresh block of ice from another italian she buys toilet paper that we can take down the hall to the lavatory and that she says is better than having the headlines from the daily news blackening your arse she boils water on the stove and spends a day at a great tin tub washing our shirts and socks diapers for the twins our two sheets our three towels she hangs everything out on the clotheslines behind the apartment house and we can watch the clothes dance in wind and sun she says you wouldn t want the neighbors to know what you have in the way of a wash but there s nothing like the sweetness of clothes dried by the sun when dad brings home the first week s wages on a friday night we know the weekend will be wonderful on saturday night mam will boil water on the stove and wash us in the great tin tub and dad will dry us malachy will turn around and show his behind dad will pretend to be shocked and we ll all laugh mam will make hot cocoa and we ll be able to stay up while dad tells us a story out of his head all we have to do is say a name mr macadorey or mr leibowitz down the hall and dad will have the two of them rowing up a river in brazil chased by indians with green noses and puce shoulders on nights like that we can drift off to sleep knowing there will be a breakfast of eggs fried tomatoes and fried bread tea with lashings of sugar and milk and later in the day a big dinner of mashed potatoes peas and ham and a trifle mam makes layers of fruit and warm delicious custard on a cake soaked in sherry when dad brings home the first week s wages and the weather is fine mam takes us to the playground she sits on a bench and talks to minnie macadorey she tells minnie stories about characters in limerick and minnie tells her about characters in belfast and they laugh because there are funny people in ireland north and south then they teach each other sad songs and malachy and i leave the swings and see saws to sit with them on the bench and sing a group of young soldiers one night in a camp were talking of sweethearts they had all seemed so merry except one young lad and he was downhearted and sad come and join us said one of the boys surely there s someone for you but ned shook his head and proudly he said i am in love with two each like a mother to me from neither of them shall i part for one is my mother god bless her and love her the other is my sweetheart malachy and i sing that song and mam and minnie laugh till they cry at the way malachy takes a deep bow and holds his arms out to mam at the end dan macadorey comes along on his way home from work and says rudy vallee better start worrying about the competition when we go home mam makes tea and bread and jam or mashed potatoes with butter and salt dad drinks the tea and eats nothing mam says god above how can you work all day and not eat he says the tea is enough she says you ll ruin your health and he tells her again that food is a shock to the system he drinks his tea and tells us stories and shows us letters and words in the daily news or he smokes a cigarette stares at the wall runs his tongue over his lips when dad s job goes into the third week he does not bring home the wages on friday night we wait for him and mam gives us bread and tea the darkness comes down and the lights come on along classon avenue other men with jobs are home already and having eggs for dinner because you can t have meat on a friday you can hear the families talking upstairs and downstairs and down the hall and bing crosby is singing on the radio brother can you spare a dime malachy and i play with the twins we know mam won t sing anyone can see why i wanted your kiss she sits at the kitchen table talking to herself what am i going to do till it s late and dad rolls up the stairs singing roddy mccorley he pushes in the door and calls for us where are my troops where are my four warriors mam says leave those boys alone they re gone to bed half hungry because you have to fill your belly with whiskey he comes to the bedroom door up boys up a nickel for everyone who promises to die for ireland deep in canadian woods we met from one bright island flown great is the land we tread but yet our hearts are with our own up boys up francis malachy oliver eugene the red branch knights the fenian men the ira up up mam is at the kitchen table shaking her hair hanging damp her face wet can t you leave them alone she says jesus mary and joseph isn t it enough that you come home without making fools of the children on top of it she comes to us go back to bed she i want them up he says i want them be free from the center to the sea don t cross me she says for if you your mother s house a penny in your pocket without says ready for the day ireland will do it ll be a sorry day in he pulls his cap down over his face and cries my poor mother poor ireland och what are we going to do mam says you re pure stone mad and she tells us again to go to bed on the morning of the fourth friday of dad s job mam asks him if he ll be home tonight with his wages or will he drink everything again he looks at us and shakes his head at mam as if to say och you shouldn t talk like that in front of the children mam keeps at him i m asking you are you coming home so that we can have a bit of supper or will it be midnight with no money in your pocket and you singing kevin barry and the rest of the sad songs he puts on his cap shoves his hands into his trouser pockets sighs and looks up at the ceiling i told you before i ll be home he says later in the day mam dresses us she puts the twins into the pram and off we go through the long streets of brooklyn sometimes she lets malachy sit in the pram when he s tired of trotting along beside her she tells me i m too big for the pram i could tell her i have pains in my legs from trying to keep up with her but she s not singing and i know this is not the day to be talking about my pains we come to a big gate where there s a man standing in a box with windows all

us the summer i was almost seven when she came the beauty of the llano unfolded before my eyes and the gurgling waters of the river sang to the hum of the turning earth the magical time of childhood stood still and the pulse of the living earth pressed its mystery into my living blood she took my hand and the silent magic powers she possessed made beauty from the raw sun baked llano the green river valley and the blue bowl which was the white sun s home my bare feet felt the throbbing earth and my body trembled with excitement time stood still and it shared with me all that had been and all that was to come let me begin at the beginning i do not mean the beginning that was in my dreams and the stories they whispered to me about my birth and the people of my father and mother and my three brothers but the beginning that came with ultima the attic of our home was partitioned into two small rooms my sisters deborah and theresa slept in one and i slept in the small cubicle by the door the wooden steps creaked down into a small hallway that led into the kitchen from the top of the stairs i had a vantage point into the heart of our home my mother s kitchen from there i was to see the terrified face of ch vez when he brought the terrible news of the murder of the sheriff i was to see the rebellion of my brothers against my father and many times late at night i was to see ultima returning from the llano where she gathered the herbs that can be harvested only in the light of the full moon by the careful hands of a curandera that night i lay very quietly in my bed and i heard my father and mother speak of ultima est sola my father said ya no queda gente en el pueblito de las pasturas he spoke in spanish and the village he mentioned was his home my father had been a vaquero all his life a calling as ancient as the coming of the spaniard to nuevo m jico even after the big rancheros and the tejanos came and fenced the beautiful llano he and those like him continued to work there i guess because only in that wide expanse of land and sky could they feel the freedom their spirits needed qu l stima my mother answered and i knew her nimble fingers worked the pattern on the doily she crocheted for the big chair in the sala i heard her sigh and she must have shuddered too when she thought of ultima living alone in the loneliness of the wide llano my mother was not a woman of the llano she was the daughter of a farmer she could not see beauty in the llano and she could not understand the coarse men who lived half their lifetimes on horseback after i was born in las pasturas she persuaded my father to leave the llano and bring her family to the town of guadalupe where she said there would be opportunity and school for us the move lowered my father in the esteem of his compadres the other vaqueros of the llano who clung tenaciously to their way of life and freedom there was no room to keep animals in town so my father had to sell his small herd but he would not sell his horse so he gave it to a good friend benito campos but campos could not keep the animal penned up because somehow the horse was very close to the spirit of the man and so the horse was allowed to roam free and no vaquero on that llano would throw a lazo on that horse it was as if someone had died and they turned their gaze from the spirit that walked the earth it hurt my father s pride he saw less and less of his old compadres he went to work on the highway and on saturdays after they collected their pay he drank with his crew at the longhorn but he was never close to the men of the town some weekends the llaneros would come into town for supplies and old amigos like bonney or campos or the gonzales brothers would come by to visit then my father s eyes lit up as they drank and talked of the old days and told the old stories but when the western sun touched the clouds with orange and gold the vaqueros got in their trucks and headed home and my father was left to drink alone in the long night sunday morning he would get up very crudo and complain about having to go to early mass she served the people all her life and now the people are scattered driven like tumbleweeds by the winds of war the war sucks everything dry my father said solemnly it takes the young boys overseas and their families move to california where there is work ave mari purisima my mother made the sign of the cross for my three brothers who were away at war gabriel she said to my father it is not right that la grande be alone in her old age no my father agreed when i married you and went to the llano to live with you and raise your family i could not have survived without la grande s help oh those were hard years those were good years my father countered but my mother would not argue there isn t a family she did not help she continued no road was too long for her to walk to its end to snatch somebody from the jaws of death and not even the blizzards of the llano could keep her from the appointed place where a baby was to be delivered es verdad my father nodded she tended me at the birth of my sons and then i knew her eyes glanced briefly at my father gabriel we cannot let her live her last days in loneliness no my father agreed it is not the way of our people it would be a great honor to provide a home for la grande my mother murmured my mother called ultima la grande out of respect it meant the woman was old and wise i have already sent word with campos that ultima is to come and live with us my father said with some satisfaction he knew it would please my mother i am grateful my mother said tenderly perhaps we can repay a little of the kindness la grande has given to so many and the children my father asked i knew why he expressed concern for me and my sisters it was because ultima was a curandera a woman who knew the herbs and remedies of the ancients a miracle worker who could heal the sick and i had heard that ultima could lift the curses laid by brujas that she could exorcise the evil the witches planted in people to make them sick and because a curandera had this power she was misunderstood and often suspected of practicing witchcraft herself i shuddered and my heart turned cold at the thought the cuentos of the people were full of the tales of evil done by brujas she helped bring them into the world she cannot be but good for the children my mother answered est bien my father yawned i will go for her in the morning so it was decided that ultima should come and live with us i knew that my father and mother did good by providing a home for ultima it was the custom to provide for the old and the sick there was always room in the safety and warmth of la familia for one more person be that person stranger or friend it was warm in the attic and as i lay quietly listening to the sounds of the house falling asleep and repeating a hail mary over and over in my thoughts i drifted into the time of dreams once i had told my mother about my dreams and she said they were visions from god and she was happy because her own dream was that i should grow up and become a priest after that i did not tell her about my dreams and they remained in me forever and ever in my dream i flew over the rolling hills of the llano my soul wandered over the dark plain until it came to a cluster of adobe huts i recognized the village of las pasturas and my heart grew happy one mud hut had a lighted window and the vision of my dream swept me towards it to be witness at the birth of a baby i could not make out the face of the mother who rested from the pains of birth but i could see the old woman in black who tended the just arrived steaming baby she nimbly tied a knot on the cord that had connected the baby to its mother s blood then quickly she bent and with her teeth she bit off the loose end she wrapped the squirming baby and laid it at the mother s side then she returned to cleaning the bed all linen was swept aside to be washed but she carefully wrapped the useless cord and the afterbirth and laid the package at the feet of the virgin on the small altar i sensed that these things were yet to be delivered to someone now the people who had waited patiently in the dark were allowed to come in and speak to the mother and deliver their gifts to the baby i recognized my mother s brothers my uncles from el puerto de los lunas they entered ceremoniously a patient hope stirred in their dark brooding eyes this one will be a luna the old man said he will be a farmer and keep our customs and traditions perhaps god will bless our family and make the baby a priest and to show their hope they rubbed the dark earth of the river valley on the baby s forehead and they surrounded the bed with the fruits of their harvest so the small room smelled of fresh green chile and corn ripe apples and peaches pumpkins and green beans then the silence was shattered with the thunder of hoofbeats vaqueros surrounded the small house with shouts and gunshots and when they entered the room they were laughing and singing and drinking gabriel they shouted you have a fine son he will make a fine vaquero and they smashed the fruits and vegetables that surrounded the bed and replaced them with a saddle horse blankets bottles of whiskey a new rope bridles chapas and an old guitar and they rubbed the stain of earth from the baby s forehead because man was not to be tied to the earth but free upon it these were the people of my father the vaqueros of the llano they were an exuberant restless people wandering across the ocean of the plain we must return to our valley the old man who led the farmers spoke we must take with us the blood that comes after the birth we will bury it in our fields to renew their fertility and to assure that the baby will follow our ways he nodded for the old woman to deliver the package at the altar no the llaneros protested it will stay here we will burn it and let the winds of the llano scatter the ashes it is blasphemy to scatter a man s blood on unholy ground the farmers chanted the new son must fulfill his mother s dream he must come to el puerto and rule over the lunas of the valley the blood of the lunas is strong in him he is a m rez the vaqueros shouted his forefathers were conquistadores men as restless as the seas they sailed and as free as the land they conquered he is his father s blood curses and threats filled the air pistols were drawn and the opposing sides made ready for battle but the clash was stopped by the old woman who delivered the baby cease she cried and the men were quiet i pulled this baby into the light of life so i will bury the afterbirth and the cord that once linked him to eternity only i will know his destiny the dream began to dissolve when i opened my eyes i heard my father cranking the truck outside i wanted to go with him i wanted to see las pasturas i wanted to see ultima i dressed hurriedly but i was too late the truck was bouncing down the goat path that led to the bridge and the highway i turned as i always did and looked down the slope of our hill to the green of the river and i raised my eyes and saw the town of guadalupe towering above the housetops and the trees of the town was the church tower i made the sign of the cross on my lips the only other building that rose above the housetops to compete with the church tower was the yellow top of the schoolhouse this fall i would be going to school my heart sank when i thought of leaving my mother and going to school a warm sick feeling came to my stomach to get rid of it i ran to the pens we kept by the molino to feed the animals i had fed the rabbits that night and they already had alfalfa and so i only changed their water i scattered some grain for the hungry chickens and watched their mad scramble as the rooster called them to peck i milked the cow and turned her loose during the day she would forage along the highway where the grass was thick and green then she would return at nightfall she was a good cow and there were very few times when i had to run and bring her back in the evening then i dreaded it because she might wander into the hills where the bats flew at dusk and there was only the sound of my heart beating as i ran and it made me sad and frightened to be alone i collected three eggs in the chicken house and returned for breakfast antonio my mother smiled and took the eggs and milk come and eat your breakfast i sat across the table from deborah and theresa and ate my atole and the hot tortilla with butter i said very little i usually spoke very little to my two sisters they were older than i and they were very close they usually spent the entire day in the attic playing dolls and giggling i did not concern myself with those things your father has gone to las pasturas my mother chattered he has gone to bring la grande her hands were white with the flour of the dough i watched carefully and when he returns i want you children to show your manners you must not shame your father or your mother isn t her real name ultima deborah asked she was like that always asking grown up questions you will address her as la grande my mother said flatly i looked at her and wondered if this woman with the black hair and laughing eyes was the woman who gave birth in my dream grande theresa repeated is it true she is a witch deborah asked oh she was in for it i saw my mother whirl then pause and control herself no she scolded you must not speak of such things oh i don t know where you learn such ways her eyes flooded with tears she always cried when she thought we were learning the ways of my father the ways of the m rez she is a woman of learning she went on and i knew she didn t have time to stop and cry she had worked hard for all the people of the village oh i would never have survived those hard years if it had not been for her so show her respect we are honored that she comes to live with us understand s mam deborah said half willingly s mam theresa repeated now run and sweep the room at the end of the hall eugene s room i heard her voice choke she breathed a prayer and crossed her forehead the flour left white stains on her the four points of the cross i knew it was because my three brothers were at war that she was sad and eugene was the youngest mam i wanted to speak to her i wanted to know who the old woman was who cut the baby s cord s she turned and looked at me was ultima at my birth i asked ay dios m o my mother cried she came to where i sat and ran her hand through my hair she smelled warm like bread where do you get such questions my son yes she smiled la grande was there to help me she was there to help at the birth of all of my children and my uncles from el puerto were there of course she answered my brothers have always been at my side when i needed them they have always prayed that i would bless them with a i did not hear what she said because i was hearing the sounds of the dream and i was seeing the dream again the warm cereal in my stomach made me feel sick and my father s brother was there the m rez and their friends the vaqueros ay she cried out don t speak to me of those worthless m rez and their friends there was a fight i asked no she said a silly argument they wanted to start a fight with my brothers that is all they are good for vaqueros they call themselves they are worthless drunks thieves always on the move like gypsies always dragging their families around the country like vagabonds as long as i could remember she always raged about the m rez family and their friends she called the village of las pasturas beautiful she had gotten used to the loneliness but she had never accepted its people she was the daughter of farmers but the dream was true it was as i had seen it ultima knew but you will not be like them she caught her breath and stopped she kissed my forehead you will be like my brothers you will be a luna antonio you will be a man of the people and perhaps a priest she smiled a priest i thought that was her dream i was to hold mass on sundays like father byrnes did in the church in town i was to hear the confessions of the silent people of the valley and i was to administer the holy sacrament to them perhaps i said yes my mother smiled she held me tenderly the fragrance of her body was sweet but then i whispered who will hear my confession what nothing i answered i felt a cool sweat on my forehead and i knew i had to run i had to clear my mind of the dream i am going to jas n s house i said hurriedly and slid past my mother i ran out the kitchen door past the animal pens towards jas n s house the white sun and the fresh air cleansed me on this side of the river there were only three houses the slope of the hill rose gradually into the hills of juniper and mesquite and cedar clumps jas n s house was farther away from the river than our house on the path that led to the bridge lived huge fat f o and his beautiful wife f o and my father worked together on the highway they were good drinking friends jas n i called at the kitchen door i had run hard and was panting his mother appeared at the door jas n no est aqu she said all of the older people spoke only in spanish and i myself understood only spanish it was only after one went to school that one learned english d nde est i asked she pointed towards the river northwest past the railroad tracks to the dark hills the river came through those hills and there were old indian grounds there holy burial grounds jas n told me there in an old cave lived his indian at least everybody called him jas n s indian he was the only indian of the town and he talked only to jas n jas n s father had forbidden jas n to talk to the indian he had beaten him he had tried in every way to keep jas n from the indian but jas n persisted jas n was not a bad boy he was just jas n he was quiet and moody and sometimes for no reason at all wild loud sounds came exploding from his throat and lungs sometimes i felt like jas n like i wanted to shout and cry but i never did i looked at his mother s eyes and i saw they were sad thank you i said and returned home while i waited for my father to return with ultima i worked in the garden every day i had to work in the garden every day i reclaimed from the rocky soil of the hill a few more feet of earth to cultivate the land of the llano was not good for farming the good land was along the river but my mother wanted a garden and i worked to make her happy already we had a few chile and tomato plants growing it was hard work my fingers bled from scraping out the rocks and it seemed that a square yard of ground produced a wheelbarrow full of rocks which i had to push down to the retaining wall the sun was white in the bright blue sky the shade of the clouds would not come until the afternoon the sweat was sticky on my brown body i heard the truck and turned to see it chugging up the dusty goat path my father was returning with ultima mam i called my mother came running out deborah and theresa trailed after her i m afraid i heard theresa whimper there s nothing to be afraid of deborah said confidently my mother said there was too much m rez blood in deborah her eyes and hair were very dark and she was always running she had been to school two years and she spoke only english she was teaching theresa and half the time i didn t understand what they were saying madre de dios but mind your manners my mother scolded the truck stopped and she ran to greet ultima buenos d as le de dios grande my mother cried she smiled and hugged and kissed the old woman ay mar a luna ultima smiled buenos d as te de dios a ti y a tu familia she wrapped the black shawl around her hair and shoulders her face was brown and very wrinkled when she smiled her teeth were brown i remembered the dream come come my mother urged us forward it was the custom to greet the old deborah my mother urged deborah stepped forward and took ultima s withered hand buenos d as grande she smiled she even bowed slightly then she pulled theresa forward and told her to greet la grande my mother beamed deborah s good manners surprised her but they made her happy because a family was judged by its manners what beautiful daughters you have raised ultima nodded to my mother nothing could have pleased my mother more she looked proudly at my father who stood leaning against the truck watching and judging the introductions antonio he said simply i stepped forward and took ultima s hand i looked up into her clear brown eyes and shivered her face was old and wrinkled but her eyes were clear and sparkling like the eyes of a young child antonio she smiled she took my hand and i felt the power of a whirlwind sweep around me her eyes swept the surrounding hills and through them i saw for the first time the wild beauty of our hills and the magic of the green river my nostrils quivered as i felt the song of the mockingbirds and the drone of the grasshoppers mingle with the pulse of the earth the four directions of the llano met in me and the white sun shone on my soul the granules of sand at my feet and the sun and sky above me seemed to dissolve into one strange complete being a cry came to my throat and i wanted to shout it and run in the beauty i had found antonio i felt my mother prod me deborah giggled because she had made the right greeting and i who was to be my mother s hope and joy stood voiceless buenos d as le de dios ultima i muttered i saw in her eyes my dream i saw the old woman who had delivered me from my mother s womb i knew she held the secret of my destiny antonio my mother was shocked i had used her name instead of calling her grande but ultima held up her hand let it be she smiled this was the last child i pulled from your womb mar a i knew there would be something between us my mother who had started to mumble apologies was quiet as you wish grande she nodded i have come to spend the last days of my life here antonio ultima said to me you will never die ultima i answered i will take care of you she let go of my hand and laughed then my father said pase grande pase nuestra casa es su casa it is too hot to stand and visit in the sun s s my mother urged i watched them go in my father carried on his shoulders the large blue tin trunk which later i learned contained all of ultima s earthly possessions the black dresses and shawls she wore and the magic of her sweet smelling herbs as ultima walked past me i smelled for the first time a trace of the sweet fragrance of herbs that always lingered in her wake many years later long after ultima was gone and i had grown to be a man i would awaken sometimes at night and think i caught a scent of her fragrance in the cool night breeze and with ultima came the owl i heard it that night for the first time in the juniper tree outside of ultima s window i knew it was her owl because the other owls of the llano did not come that near the house at first it disturbed me and deborah and theresa too i heard them whispering through the partition i heard deborah reassuring theresa that she would take care of her and then she took theresa in her arms and rocked her until they were both asleep i waited i was sure my father would get up and shoot the owl with the old rifle he kept on the kitchen wall but he didn t and i accepted his understanding in many cuentos i had heard the owl was one of the disguises a bruja took and so it struck a chord of fear in the heart to hear them hooting at night but not ultima s owl its soft hooting was like a song and as it grew rhythmic it calmed the moonlit hills and lulled us to sleep its song seemed to say that it had come to watch over us i dreamed about the owl that night and my dream was good la virgen de guadalupe was the patron saint of our town the town was named after her in my dream i saw ultima s owl lift la virgen on her wide wings and fly her to heaven then the owl returned and gathered up all the babes of limbo and flew them up to the clouds of heaven the virgin smiled at the goodness of the owl

downtown manhattan clear winter noon and i ve been up all night talking talking reading the kaddish aloud listening to ray charles blues shout blind on the phonograph the rhythm the rhythm and your memory in my head three years after and read adonais last triumphant stanzas aloud wept realizing how we suffer and how death is that remedy all singers dream of sing remember prophesy as in the hebrew anthem or the buddhist book of an swers and my own imagination of a withered leaf at dawn dreaming back thru life your time and mine accelerating toward apoca lypse the final moment the flower burning in the day and what comes after looking back on the mind itself that saw an american city a flash away and the great dream of me or china or you and a phantom russia or a crumpled bed that never existed like a poem in the dark escaped back to oblivion no more to say and nothing to weep for but the beings in the dream trapped in its disappearance sighing screaming with it buying and selling pieces of phantom worship ping each other worshipping the god included in it all longing or inevitability while it lasts a vision anything more it leaps about me as i go out and walk the street look back over my shoulder seventh avenue the battlements of window office buildings shoul dering each other high under a cloud tall as the sky an instant and the sky above an old blue place or down the avenue to the south to as i walk toward the lower east side where you walked years ago little girl from russia eating the first poisonous tomatoes of america frightened on the dock then struggling in the crowds of orchard street toward what toward newark toward candy store first home made sodas of the century hand churned ice cream in backroom on musty brownfloor boards toward education marriage nervous breakdown operation teaching school and learning to be mad in a dream what is this life toward the key in the window and the great key lays its head of light on top of manhattan and over the floor and lays down on the sidewalk in a single vast beam moving as i walk down first toward the yiddish theater and the place of poverty you knew and i know but without caring now strange to have moved thru paterson and the west and europe and here again with the cries of spaniards now in the doorstops doors and dark boys on the street fire escapes old as you tho you re not old now that s left here with me myself anyhow maybe as old as the universe and i guess that dies with us enough to cancel all that comes what came is gone forever every time that s good that leaves it open for no regret no fear radiators lacklove torture even toothache in the end though while it comes it is a lion that eats the soul and the lamb the soul in us alas offering itself in sacrifice to change s fierce hunger hair and teeth and the roar of bonepain skull bare break rib rot skin braintricked implacability ai ai we do worse we are in a fix and you re out death let you out death had the mercy you re done with your century done with god done with the path thru it done with yourself at last pure back to the babe dark before your father before us all before the world there rest no more suffering for you i know where you ve gone it s good no more flowers in the summer fields of new york no joy now no more fear of louis and no more of his sweetness and glasses his high school decades debts loves frightened telephone calls conception beds relatives hands no more of sister elanor she gone before you we kept it secret you killed her or she killed herself to bear with you an arthritic heart but death s killed you both no matter nor your memory of your mother tears in silent movies weeks and weeks forgetting agrieve watching marie dressler address human ity chaplin dance in youth or boris godunov chaliapin s at the met halling his voice of a weeping czar by standing room with elanor max watching also the capital ists take seats in orchestra white furs diamonds with the ypsl s hitch hiking thru pennsylvania in black baggy gym skirts pants photograph of girls holding each other round the waste and laughing eye too coy virginal solitude of all girls grown old or dead now and that long hair in the grave lucky to have husbands later you made it i came too eugene my brother before still grieving now and will gream on to his last stiff hand as he goes thru his cancer or kill later perhaps soon he will think and it s the last moment i remember which i see them all thru myself now tho not you i didn t foresee what you felt what more hideous gape of bad mouth came first to you and were you prepared to go where in that dark that in that god a radiance a lord in the void like an eye in the black cloud in a dream adonoi at last with you beyond my remembrance incapable to guess not merely the yellow skull in the grave or a box of worm dust and a stained ribbon deaths head with halo can you believe it is it only the sun that shines once for the mind only the flash of existence than none ever was nothing beyond what we have what you had that so pitiful yet tri umph to have been here and changed like a tree broken or flower fed to the ground but made with its petals colored thinking great universe shaken cut in the head leaf stript hid in an egg crate hospital cloth wrapped sore freaked in the moon brain naughtless no flower like that flower which knew itself in the garden and fought the knife lost cut down by an idiot snowman s icy even in the spring strange ghost thought some death sharp icicle in his hand crowned with old roses a dog for his eyes cock of a sweatshop heart of electric irons all the accumulations of life that wear us out clocks bodies consciousness shoes breasts begotten sons your communism paranoia into hospitals you once kicked elanor in the leg she died of heart failure later you of stroke asleep within a year the two of you sisters in death is elanor happy max grieves alive in an office on lower broadway lone large mustache over midnight accountings not sure his life passes as he sees and what does he doubt now still dream of making money or that might have made money hired nurse had children found even your im mortality naomi i ll see him soon now i ve got to cut through to talk to you as i didn t when you had a mouth forever and we re bound for that forever like emily dickinson s horses headed to the end they know the way these steeds run faster than we think it s our own life they cross and take with them magnificent mourned no more marred of heart mind behind mar ried dreamed mortal changed ass and face done with murder in the world given flower maddened made no utopia shut under pine almed in earth blamed in lone jehovah accept nameless one faced forever beyond me beginningless endless father in death tho i am not there for this prophecy i am unmarried i m hymnless i m heavenless headless in blisshood i would still adore thee heaven after death only one blessed in nothingness not light or darkness dayless eternity take this this psalm from me burst from my hand in a day some of my time now given to nothing to praise thee but death this is the end the redemption from wilderness way for the won derer house sought for all black handkerchief washed clean by weeping page beyond psalm last change of mine and naomi to god s perfect darkness death stay thy phantoms ii over and over refrain of the hospitals still haven t written your history leave it abstract a few images run thru the mind like the saxophone chorus of houses and years remembrance of electrical shocks by long nites as a child in paterson apartment watching over your nervousness you were fat your next move by that afternoon i stayed home from school to take care of you once and for all when i vowed forever that once man disagreed with my opinion of the cosmos i was lost by my later burden vow to illuminate mankind this is release of particulars mad as you sanity a trick of agreement but you stared out the window on the broadway church corner and spied a mystical assassin from newark so phoned the doctor ok go way for a rest so i put on my coat and walked you downstreet on the way a grammarschool boy screamed unaccountably where you goin lady to death i shuddered and you covered your nose with motheaten fur collar gas mask against poison sneaked into downtown atmosphere sprayed by grandma and was the driver of the cheesebox public service bus a member of the gang you shuddered at his face i could hardly get you on to new york very times square to grab another greyhound where we hung around hours

preachings of peter selections from pseudo clement homilies lyrics anonymous messenger of satan ca the letter of peter to james peter to james the lord and bishop of the holy church by the father of all things through jesus christ may you be in peace always knowing that you my brother eagerly pursue what is of common benefit to us all i request and implore you not to impart the books of my preachings which i am sending you to any of the gentiles nor even to a fellow jew before he is tested but if someone upon examination is found worthy then to him you may hand them over in the same way as moses handed on the tradition to the seventy who succeeded to his chair because of this the fruit of his precaution is apparent until the present for his fellow nationals everywhere hold to the same rule of monotheism and the same moral constitution since they cannot be led by the ambiguities of scripture to adopt any other viewpoint rather they try to correct the disagreements of the scriptures according to the norm handed down to them in case anyone who chances not to know the traditions should be shocked by the ambiguous statements of the prophets for this reason they permit no one to teach until he has learned how the scriptures ought to be used thus among them there is one god one law one hope in order then that the same situation may obtain among us hand over the books of my preachings to our seventy brothers with similar secrecy that they may prepare those who want to take up the office of teacher otherwise if this is not done our word of truth will be divided into many opinions it is not as a prophet that i know this rather i already see the beginning of this evil for some of those of gentile origin have rejected my lawful proclamation accepting rather a lawless and silly teaching of the enemy and even while i am still alive some have undertaken to distort my words by certain intricate interpretations into an abolition of the law as if i myself thought such a thing but did not preach it openly god forbid for to take such a position is to act against the law of god which was spoken through moses and whose eternal endurance was attested by our lord for he said heaven and earth will pass away not an iota not a dot will pass from the law and he said this that everything might come to pass but these people who have my mind at their disposal i know not how undertake to interpret the words which they heard from me more intelligently than i who spoke them they tell those who are taking instruction from them that this is my opinion something i never dreamed of if they dare to fabricate this kind of lies while i am still alive how much more will they dare to do who come after me homily ii as in the beginning god who is one created first the heaven then the earth like a right and left hand so he also arranged all the pairs in sequence in the case of men however he no longer does this but reverses all the pairs for while from him the first things are better the second inferior in the case of men we find the opposite the first things are worse the second better thus from adam who was made in the image of god came first the unjust cain second the just abel again from the one whom you call deucalion symbols of two spirits were sent forth an impure and a pure that is the black raven and the white dove second and from the founder of our nation abraham two different ones were born first ishmael then isaac who was blessed by god in the same way again two issued from isaac esau the impious and jacob the pious thus in order came first as firstborn in the world the high priest sc aaron then the lawgiver sc moses in the same way for the pair pertaining to elijah which ought to come next was deliberately postponed until another time to take it up according to plan at another appropriate moment therefore he who is among those born of women came first then he who is among the sons of men appeared second by following this sequence anyone can understand to whom simon i e paul belongs who first went to the gentiles before me and to whom i sc peter belong who came after him appearing as light after darkness as knowledge after ignorance as healing after sickness thus as the true prophet told us first a false gospel must come through a certain deceiver and then after the destruction of the holy place a true gospel must be propagated secretly in order to rectify the existing heresies homily xi our lord and prophet who commissioned us explained to us how the evil one having disputed with him without success for forty days promised to send apostles from his retinue for the purpose of deception therefore remember above all not to receive any apostle or prophet or teacher who has not first presented his gospel to james who is called the brother of the lord and to whom the direction of the church of the hebrews in jerusalem was entrusted and comes to you with witnesses otherwise the wickedness that disputed with the lord for forty days and could do nothing and which later fell like lightning from heaven to earth would send against you a herald as now he has sent simon against us preaching under pretext of the truth in the name of our lord but actually sowing error for this reason the one who commissioned us said many shall come to you in sheep s clothing but inwardly they are ravenous wolves by their fruits you shall know them homily xvii when simon heard this he interrupted peter to say you assert that you thoroughly understand your teacher s concerns because in his physical presence you saw and heard him directly but no one else could gain such understanding by means of a dream or a vision but i shall show that this is false one who hears something directly cannot be quite certain about what was said for the mind must consider whether being merely human he has been deceived by the sense impression but the vision by the very act of appearing presents its own proof to the seer that it is divine first give me an answer to this and peter said the prophet once he has proved that he is a prophet is infallibly believed in the matters which are directly spoken by him also when his truthfulness has been previously recognized he can give answers to the disciple however the latter may wish to examine and interrogate him but one who puts his trust in a vision or an apparition or dream is in a precarious position for he does not know what it is he is trusting for it is possible that it is an evil demon or a deceitful spirit pretending in the speeches to be what he is not then if anyone should wish to inquire who it was who spoke he could say of himself whatever he chose thus like an evil flash of lightning he stays as long as he chooses and then vanishes not remaining with the inquirer long enough to answer his questions and peter said we know that many idolaters and adulterers and all kinds of sinners have seen visions and true dreams while others have seen appearances of demons for i assert that it is not possible to see the incorporeal form of father or son because mortal eyes are dazzled by the great light therefore it is not because god is jealous but because he is merciful that he remains invisible to flesh oriented man for no one who sees can survive for the extraordinary light would dissolve the flesh of the beholder unless the flesh were changed by the ineffable power of god into the nature of light so that it could see the light or unless the light substance were changed into flesh so that it could be seen by flesh for the son alone is able to see the father without being transformed the case of the righteous is different in the resurrection of the dead when their bodies changed into light become like angels then they will be able to see finally even if an angel is sent to appear to a man he is changed into flesh that he can be seen by flesh for no one can see the incorporeal power of the son or even of an angel but if someone sees a vision let him understand this to be an evil demon but it is obvious that impious people also see true visions and dreams and i can prove it from scripture the cases of abimelech gen ff the egyptian pharaoh gen and nebuchadnezzar dan are adduced thus the fact that one sees visions and dreams and apparitions by no means assures that he is a religious person father to the pure and innate religious mind the truth gushes up not eagerly courted by a dream but granted to the good by intelligence it was in this way that the son was revealed to me by the father therefore i know what the nature of revelation is since i learned it myself the following passage discusses peter s confession as recounted in matt then cites num you see how revelations of anger are through visions and dreams while those to a friend are mouth to mouth by sight and not by puzzles and visions and dreams as they are to an enemy so even if our jesus did appear in a dream to you making himself known and conversing with you he did so in anger speaking to an opponent that is why he spoke to you through visions and dreams through revelations which are external but can anyone be qualified by a vision to become a teacher and if you say it is possible then why did the teacher remain for a whole year conversing with those who were awake how can we believe even your statement that he appeared to you how could he have appeared to you when your opinions are opposed to his teaching no if you were visited and taught by him for a single hour and thus became an apostle proclaim his utterances interpret his teachings love his apostles and do not strive against me who was his companion for you have opposed me the firm rock foundation of the church if you were not an enemy you would not slander me and disparage what is preached by me as if i were obviously condemned and you were approved if you call me condemned you are accusing god who revealed the christ to me and are opposing the one who blessed me because of the revelation rather if you really want to work together for the truth first learn from us what we learned from him then having become a disciple of the truth become our fellow worker notes the enemy lit the hostile man the phrase is probably suggested by matt as recog below makes plain paul was meant in the original version of the preachings cf matt where however the last clause reads until everything comes to pass accepting wieseler s emendation the text reads two first cf matt luke so the greek the parallel passage in the recognitions reads testimonials the recognitions passage adds in a sentence that may well go back to the original kerygmata a comparison of the twelve apostles with the twelve months of the year thus tacitly declaring any thirteenth claimant to apostolicity such as paul to be inauthentic luke probably understood here as an allusion to paul s damascus vision see acts and below hom xvii this phrase shows that simon magus could not have been meant by the original kerygmata for simon who regarded himself as a manifestation of the supreme power did not preach in the name of the lord matt f this may be another allusion to acts see above hom

how all this young boy ever wanted was happiness all he ever wanted was positivity all he ever wanted to do was entertain and this boy went through hell you gotta understand his mother was racist which is crazy cause how in the fuck is you gonna have all these black babies with black men but you racist like bitch that don t make no sense but it is what it is you know he grew up her callin him a nigger the kids at school callin him a cracker identifying as black looking as white being told what you can or can t be this kid went through everything he went through he saw narcotics in the household violence murderers drug dealers he was kidnapped there was crazy shit that happened to this kid and he persevered while the whole world said what they said said you wouldn t be shit you ain t gon be nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothing and i and he he said fuck that i ma persevere and that s why the message is always peace love and positivity see

contributorarabian nights vol chap lyricstale of kamar al zaman that there was in times of yore and in ages long gone before a king called shahrim n fn who was lord of many troops and guards and officers and who reigned over certain islands known as the kh lid n islands fn on the borders of the land of the persians but he was stricken in years and his bones were wasted without having been blessed with a son albeit he had four wives daughters of kings and threescore concubines with each of whom he was wont to lie one night in turn fn this preyed upon his mind and disquieted him so that he complained thereof to one of his wazirs saying verily i fear lest my kingdom be lost when i die for that i have no son to succeed me the minister answered o king peradventure allah shall yet bring something to pass so rely upon the almighty and be instant in prayer it is also my counsel that thou spread a banquet and invite to it the poor and needy and let them eat of thy food and supplicate the lord to vouchsafe thee a son for perchance there may be among thy guests a righteous soul whose prayers find acceptance and thereby thou shalt win thy wish so the king rose made the lesser ablution and prayed a two bow prayer fn then he cried upon allah with pure intention after which he called his chief wife to bed and lay with her forthright by grace of god she conceived and when her months were accomplished she bore a male child like the moon on the night of fulness the king named him kamar al zam n fn and rejoiced in him with extreme joy and bade the city be dressed out in his honour so they decorated the streets seven days whilst the drums beat and the messengers bore the glad tidings abroad then wet and dry nurses were provided for the boy and he was reared in splendour and delight until he reached the age of fifteen he grew up of surpassing beauty and seemlihead and symmetry and his father loved him so dear that he could not brook to be parted from him day or night one day he complained to a certain of his ministers anent the excess of his love for his only child saying o thou the wazir of a truth i fear for my son kamar al zaman the shifts and accidents which befal man and fain would i marry him in my life time answered the wazir o king know thou that marriage is one of the most honourable of moral actions and thou wouldst indeed do well and right to marry thy son in thy lifetime ere thou make him sultan on this quoth the king hither with my son kamar al zaman so he came and bowed his head to the ground in modesty before his sire o kamar al zaman said king shahriman of a truth i desire to marry thee and rejoice in thee during my lifetime replied he o my father know that i have no lust to marry nor cloth my soul incline to women for that concerning their craft and perfidy i have read many books and heard much talk even as saith the poet now an of women ask ye i reply in their affairs i m versed a doctor rare when man s head grizzles and his money dwindles in their affections he hath naught for share and another said rebel against women and so shalt thou serve allah the more the youth who gives women the rein must forfeit all hope to soar they ll baulk him when seeking the strange device excelsior tho waste he a thousand of years in the study of science and lore and when he had ended his verses he continued o my father wedlock is a thing whereto i will never consent no not though i drink the cup of death when sultan shahriman heard these words from his son light became darkness in his sight and he grieved thereat with great grief and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say when it was the one hundred and seventy first night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when king shahriman heard these words from his son the light became darkness in his sight and he grieved over his son s lack of obedience to his directions in the matter of marriage yet for the great love he bore him he was unwilling to repeat his wishes and was not wroth with him but caressed him and spake him fair and showed him all manner of kindness such as tendeth to induce affection all this and kamar al zaman increased daily in beauty and loveliness and amorous grace and the king bore with him for a whole year till he became perfect in eloquence and elegant wit all men were ravished with his charms and every breeze that blew bore the tidings of his gracious favour his fair sight was a seduction to the loving and a garden of delight to the longing for he was honey sweet of speech and the sheen of his face shamed the full moon he was a model of symmetry and blandishment and engaging ways his shape was as the willow wand or the rattan cane and his cheeks might take the place of rose or red anemone he was in fine the pink of perfection even as the poet hath said of him he came and cried they now be allah blest praise him that clad that soul in so fair vest he s king of beauty where the beauteous be all are his ryots fn all obey his hest his lip dew s sweeter than the virgin honey his teeth are pearls in double row close press all charms are congregate in him alone and deals his loveliness to man unrest beauty wrote on those cheeks for worlds to see i testify there is none good but he fn when the year came to an end the king called his son to him and said o my son wilt thou not hearken to me whereupon kamar al zaman fell down for respect and shame before his sire and replied o my father how should i not hearken to thee seeing that allah commandeth me to obey thee and not gain say thee rejoined king shahriman o my son know that i desire to marry thee and rejoice in thee whilst yet i live and make thee king over my realm before my death when the prince heard his sire pronounce these words he bowed his head awhile then raised it and said o my father this is a thing which i will never do no not though i drink the cup of death i know of a surety that the almighty hath made obedience to thee a duty in religion but allah upon thee press me not in this matter of marriage nor fancy that i will ever marry my life long for that i have read the books both of the ancients and the moderns and have come to know all the mischiefs and miseries which have befallen them through women and their endless artifices and how excellent is the saying of the poet he whom the randy motts entrap shall never see deliverance though build he forts a thousand fold whose mighty strength lead plates enhance fn their force shall be of no avail these fortresses have not a chance women aye deal in treachery to far and near o er earth s expanse with fingers dipt in henna blood and locks in braids that mad the glance and eyelids painted o er with kohl they gar us drink of dire mischance and how excellently saith another women for all the chastity they claim are offal cast by kites where er they list this night their talk and secret charms are shine that night another joyeth calf and wrist like inn whence after night thou far st at dawn and lodges other wight thou hast not wist fn now when king shahriman heard these his son s words and learnt the import of his verses and poetical quotations he made no answer of his excessive love for him but redoubled in graciousness and kindness to him he at once broke up the audience and as soon as the seance was over he summoned his minister and taking him apart said to him o thou the wazir tell me how i shall deal with my son in the matter of marriage and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted stay when it was the one hundred and seventy second night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the king summoned his minister and taking him apart said to him o thou the wazir tell me what i shall do with my son in the matter of marriage of a truth i took counsel with thee thereon and thou didst counsel me to marry him before making him king i have spoken with him of wedlock time after time and he still gainsaid me so do thou o wazir forthright advise me what to do answered the minister o king wait another year and if after that thou be minded to speak to him on the matter of marriage speak not to him privily but address him on a day of state when all the emirs and wazirs are present with the whole of the army standing before thee and when all are in crowd then send for thy son kamar al zaman and summon him and when he cometh broach to him the matter of marriage before the wazirs and grandees and officers of state and captains for he will surely be bashful and daunted by their presence and will not dare to oppose thy will now when king shahriman heard his wazir s words he rejoiced with exceeding joy seeing success in the project and bestowed on him a splendid robe of honour then he took patience with his son another year whilst with every day that passed over him kamar al zaman increased in beauty and loveliness and elegance and perfect grace till he was nigh twenty years old indeed allah had clad him in the cloak of comeliness and had crowned him with the crown of completion his eye glance was more bewitching than h r t and mar t fn and the play of his luring looks more misleading than t gh t fn and his cheeks shone like the dawn rosy red and his eyelashes stormed the keen edged blade the whiteness of his brow resembled the moon shining bright and the blackness of his locks was as the murky night and his waist was more slender than the gossamer fn and his back parts than two sand heaps bulkier making a babel of the heart with their softness but his waist complained of the weight of his hips and loins and his charms ravished all mankind even as one of the poets saith in these couplets by his eyelash tendril curled by his slender waist i swear by the dart his witchery feathers fatal hurtling through the air by the just roundness of his shape by his glances bright and keen by the swart limping of his locks and his fair forehead shining sheen by his eyebrows which deny that she who looks on them should sleep which now commanding now forbidding o er me high dominion keep by the roses of his cheek his face as fresh as myrtle wreath his tulip lips and those pure pearls that hold the places of his teeth by his noble form which rises featly turned in even swell to where upon his jutting chest two young pomegranates seem to dwell by his supple moving hips his taper waist the silky skin by all he robbed perfection of and holds enchained his form within by his tongue of steadfastness his nature true and excellent by the greatness of his rank his noble birth and high descent musk from my love her savour steals who musk exhales from every limb and all the airs ambergris breathes are but the zephyr s blow o er him the sun methinks the broad bright sun as low before my love should quail as would my love himself transcend the paltry paring of his nail fn so king shahriman having accepted the counsel of his wazir waited for another year and a great festival and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say when it was the one hundred and seventy third night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that shahriman having accepted the counsel of his wazir waited for another year and a great festival a day of state when the audience hall was filled with his emirs and wazirs and grandees of his reign and officers of state and captains of might and main thereupon he sent for his son kamar al zaman who came and kissing the ground before him three times stood in presence of his sire with his hands behind his back the right grasping the left fn then said the king to him know o my son that i have not sent for thee on this occasion and summoned thee to appear before this assembly and all these officers of estate here awaiting our orders save and except that i may lay a commandment on thee wherein do thou not disobey me and my commandment is that thou marry for i am minded to wed thee to a king s daughter and rejoice in thee ere i die when the prince heard this much from his royal sire he bowed his head groundwards awhile then raising it towards his father and being moved thereto at that time by youthful folly and boyish ignorance replied but for myself i will never marry no not though i drink the cup of death as for thee thou art great in age and small of wit hast thou not twice ere this day and before this occasion questioned me of the matter of marriage and i refused my consent indeed thou dotest and are not fit to govern a flock of sheep so saying kamar al zaman unclasped his hands from behind his back and tucked up his sleeves above his elbows before his father being in a fit of fury moreover he added many words to his sire knowing not what he said in the trouble of his spirits the king was confounded and ashamed for that this befel in the presence of his grandees and soldier officers assembled on a high festival and a state occasion but presently the majesty of kingship took him and he cried out at his son and made him tremble then he called to the guards standing before him and said seize him so they came forward and laid hands on him and binding him brought him before his sire who bade them pinion his elbows behind his back and in this guise make him stand before the presence and the prince bowed down his head for fear and apprehension and his brow and face were beaded and spangled with sweat and shame and confusion troubled him sorely thereupon his father abused him and reviled him and cried woe to thee thou son of adultery and nursling of abomination fn how durst thou answer me on this wise before my captains and soldiers but hitherto none hath chastised thee and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say when it was the one hundred and seventy fourth night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that king shahriman cried out to his son kamar al zaman how durst thou answer me on this wise before my captains and soldiers but hitherto none hath chastised thee knowest thou not that this deed thou hast done were a disgrace to him had it been done by the meanest of my subjects and the king commanded his mamelukes to loose his elbow bonds and imprison him in one of the bastions of the citadel so they took the prince and thrust him into an old tower wherein there was a dilapidated saloon and in its middle a ruined well after having first swept it and cleansed its floor flags and set therein a couch on which they laid a mattress a leathern rug and a cushion and then they brought a great lanthorn and a wax candle for that place was dark even by day and lastly the mamelukes led kamar al zaman thither and stationed an eunuch at the door and when all this was done the prince threw himself on the couch sad spirited and heavy hearted blaming himself and repenting of his injurious conduct to his father whenas repentance availed him naught and saying allah curse marriage and marriageable and married women the traitresses all would i had hearkened to my father and accepted a wife had i so done it had been better for me than this jail this is how it fared with him but as regards king shahri man he remained seated on his throne all through the day until sundown then he took the minister apart and said to him know thou o wazir that thou and thou only west the cause of all this that hath come to pass between me and my son by the advice thou west pleased to devise and so what dost thou counsel me to do now answered he o king leave thy son in limbo for the space of fifteen days then summon him to thy presence and bid him wed and assuredly he shall not gainsay thee again and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say when it was the one hundred and seventy fifth night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the wazir said to king shahriman leave thy son in limbo for the space of fifteen days then summon him to thy presence and bid him wed and assuredly he shall not gainsay thee again the king accepted the wazir s opinion and lay down to sleep that night troubled at heart concerning his son for he loved him with dearest love because he had no other child but this and it was his wont every night not to sleep save after placing his arm under his son s neck so he passed that night in trouble and unease on the prince s account tossing from side to side as he were laid on coals of artemisia wood fn for he was overcome with doubts and fears and sleep visited him not all that livelong night but his eyes ran over with tears and he began repeating while slanderers slumber longsome is my night suffice thee a heart so sad in parting plight i say while night in care slow moments by what no return for thee fair morning light and the saying of another when saw i pleiad stars his glance escape and pole star draught of sleep upon him pour and the bier daughters fn wend in mourning dight i knew that morning was for him no more such was the case with king shahriman but as regards kamar al zaman when the night came upon him the eunuch set the lanthorn before him and lighting the wax candle placed it in the candlestick then brought him somewhat of food the prince ate a little and continually reproached himself for his unseemly treatment of his father saying to himself o my soul knowest thou not that a son of adam is the hostage of his tongue and that a man s tongue is what casteth him into deadly perils then his eyes ran over with tears and he bewailed that which he had done from anguished vitals and aching heart repenting him with exceeding repentance of the wrong wherewith he had wronged his father and repeating fair youth shall die by stumbling of the tongue stumble of foot works not man s life such wrong the slip of lip shall oft smite off the head while slip of foot shall never harm one long now when he had made an end of eating he asked for the wherewithal to wash his hands and when the mameluke had washed them clean of the remnants of food he arose and made the wuzu ablution and prayed the prayers of sundown and nightfall conjoining them in one after which he sat down and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say when it was the hundred and seventy sixth night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the prince kamar al zaman had prayed conjoining them in one the prayers of sundown and nightfall he sat down on the well and began reciting the koran and he repeated the cow the house of imr n and y s the compassionate blessed be the king unity and the two talismans fn and he ended with blessing and supplication and with saying i seek refuge with allah from satan the stoned fn then he lay down upon his couch which was covered with a mattress of satin from al ma adin town the same on both sides and stuffed with the raw silk of irak and under his head was a pillow filled with ostrich down and when ready for sleep he doffed his outer clothes and drew off his bag trousers and lay down in a shirt of delicate stuff smooth as wax and he donned a head kerchief of azure mar zi fn cloth and at such time and on this guise kamar al zaman was like the full orbed moon when it riseth on its fourteenth night then drawing over his head a coverlet of silk he fell asleep with the lanthorn burning at his feet and the wax candle over his head and he ceased not sleeping through the first third of the night not knowing what lurked for him in the womb of the future and what the omniscient had decreed for him now as fate and fortune would have it both tower and saloon were old and had been many years deserted and there was therein a roman well inhabited by a jinniyah of the seed of iblis fn the accursed by name maym nah daughter of al dimiry t a renowned king of the j nn and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say when it was the one hundred and seventy seventh night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the name of the jinniyah in question was maymunah daughter of al dimiryat a renowned king of the jann and as kamar al zaman continued sleeping till the first third of the night maymunah came up out of the roman well and made for the firmament thinking to listen by stealth to the converse of the angels but when she reached the mouth of the well she saw a light shining in the tower contrary to custom and having dwelt there many years without seeing the like she said to herself never have i witnessed aught like this and marvelling much at the matter determined that there must be some cause therefor so she made for the light and found the eunuch sleeping within the door and inside she saw a couch spread whereon was a human form with the wax candle burning at his head and the lanthorn at his feet and she wondered to see the light and stole towards it little by little then she folded her wings and stood by the bed and drawing back the coverlid discovered kamar al zaman s face she was motionless for a full hour in admiration and wonderment for the lustre of his visage outshone that of the candle his face beamed like a pearl with light his eyelids were languorous like those of the gazelle the pupils of his eyes were intensely black and brilliant fn his cheeks were rosy red his eye brows were arched like bows and his breath exhaled a scent of musk even as saith of him the poet i kissed him darker grew those pupils fn which seduce my soul and cheeks flushed rosier hue o heart if slanderers dare to deem there be his like in chasms say bring him hither you now when maymunah saw him she pronounced the formula of praise fn and said blessed be allah the best of creators for she was of the true believing jinn and she stood awhile gazing on his face exclaiming and envying the youth his beauty and loveliness and she said in herself by allah i will do no hurt to him nor let any harm him nay from all of evil will i ransom him for this fair face deserveth not but that folk should gaze upon it and for it praise the lord yet how could his family find it in their hearts to leave him in such desert place where if one of our m rids came upon him at this hour he would assuredly slay him then the ifritah maymunah bent over him and kissed him between the eyes and presently drew back the sheet over his face which she covered up and after this she spread her wings and soaring into the air flew upwards and after rising high from the circle of the saloon she ceased not winging her way through air and ascending skywards till she drew near the heaven of this world the lowest of the heavens and behold she heard the noisy flapping of wings cleaving the welkin and directing herself by the sound she found when she drew near it that the noise came from an ifrit called dahnash so she swooped down on him like a sparrow hawk and when he was aware of her and knew her to be maymunah the daughter of the king of the jinn he feared her and his side muscles quivered and he implored her forbearance saying i conjure thee by the most great and august name and by the most noble talisman graven upon the seal ring of solomon entreat me kindly and harm me not when she heard these words her heart inclined to him and she said verily thou conjurest me o accursed with a mighty conjuration nevertheless i will not let thee go till thou tell me whence thou comest at this hour he replied o princess know that i come from the uttermost end of china land and from among the islands and i will tell thee of a wonderful thing i have seen this night if thou kind my words true let me wend my way and write me a patent under thy hand and with thy sign manual that i am thy freedman so none of the jinn hosts whether of the upper who fly or of the lower who walk the earth or of those who dive beneath the waters do me let or hindrance rejoined maymunah and what is it thou hast seen this night o liar o accursed tell me without leasing and think not to escape from my hand with falses for i swear to thee by the letters graven upon the bezel of the seal ring of solomon david son on both of whom be peace except thy speech be true i will pluck out thy feathers with mine own hand and strip off thy skin and break thy bones quoth the ifrit dahnash son of shamh rish fn the flyer i accept o my lady these conditions and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say when it was the one hundred and seventy eight night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that dahnash spoke thus to maymunah i accept o my lady these conditions then he resumed know o my mistress that i come to night from the islands of the inland sea in the parts of china which are the realms of king ghay r lord of the islands and the seas and the seven palaces there i saw a daughter of his than whom allah hath made none fairer in her time i cannot picture her to thee for my tongue would fail to describe her with her due of praise but i will name to thee a somewhat of her charms by way of approach now her hair is like the nights of disunion and separation and her face like the days of union and delectation and right well hath the poet said when picturing her she dispread the locks from her head one night showing four fold nights into one night run and she turned her visage towards the moon and two moons showed at moment one she hath a nose like the edge of the burnished blade and cheeks like purple wine or anemones blood red her lips as coral and carnelian shine and the water of her mouth is sweeter than old wine its taste would quench hell s fiery pain her tongue is moved by wit of high degree and ready repartee her breast is a seduction to all that see it glory be to him who fashioned it and finished it and joined thereto are two upper arms smooth and rounded even as saith of her the poet al walah n fn she hath wrists which did her bangles not contain would run from out her sleeves in silvern rain she hath breasts like two globes of ivory from whose brightness the moons borrow light and a stomach with little waves as it were a figured cloth of the finest egyptian linen made by the copts with creases like folded scrolls ending in a waist slender past all power of imagination based upon back parts like a hillock of blown sand that force her to sit when she would fief stand and awaken her when she fain would sleep even as saith of her and describeth her the poet she hath those hips conjoined by thread of waist hips that o er me and her too tyrannise my thoughts they daze whene er i think of them and weigh her down whene er she would uprise fn and those back parts are upborne by thighs smooth and round and by a calf like a column of pearl and all this reposeth upon two feet narrow slender and pointed like spear blades fn the handiwork of the protector and requiter i wonder how of their littleness they can sustain what is above them but i cut short my praises of her charms fearing lest i be tedious and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say when it was the one hundred and seventy ninth night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the ifrit dahnash bin shamhurish said to the ifritah maymunah of a truth i cut short my praises fearing lest i be tedious now when maymunah heard the description of that princess and her beauty and loveliness she stood silent in astonishment whereupon dahnash resumed the father of this fair maiden is a mighty king a fierce knight immersed night and day in fray and fight for whom death hath no fright and the escape of his foe no dread for that he is a tyrant masterful and a conqueror irresistible lord of troops and armies and continents and islands and cities and villages and his name is king ghayur lord of the islands and of the seas and of the seven palaces now he loveth his daughter the young maiden whom i have described to thee with dearest love and for affection of her he hath heaped together the treasures of all the kings and built her therewith seven palaces each of a different fashion the first of crystal the second of marble the third of china steel the fourth of precious stones and gems of price the fifth of porcelain and many hued onyxes and ring bezels the sixth of silver and the seventh of gold and he hath filled the seven palaces with all sorts of sumptuous furniture rich silken carpets and hangings and vessels of gold and silver and all manner of gear that kings require and hath bidden his daughter to abide in each by turns for a certain season of the year and her name is the princess budur fn now when her beauty became known and her name and fame were bruited abroad in the neighbouring countries all the kings sent to her father to demand her of him in marriage and he consulted her on the matter but she disliked the very word wedlock with a manner of abhorrence and said o my father i have no mind to marry no not at all for i am a sovereign lady and a queen suzerain ruling over men and i have no desire for a man who shall rule over me and the more suits she refused the more her suitors eagerness increased and all the royalties of the inner islands of china sent presents and rarities to her father with letters asking her in marriage so he pressed her again and again with advice on the matter of espousals but she ever opposed to him refusals till at last she turned upon him angrily and cried o my father if thou name matrimony to me once more i will go into my chamber and take a sword and fixing its hilt in the ground will set its point to my waist then will i press upon it till it come forth from my back and so slay myself now when the king heard these her words the light became darkness in his sight and his heart burned for her as with a flame of fire because he feared lest she should kill herself and he was filled with perplexity concerning her affair and the kings her suitors so he said to her if thou be determined not to marry and there be no help for it abstain from going and coming in and out then he placed her in a house and shut her up in a chamber appointing ten old women as duennas to guard her and forbade her to go forth to the seven palaces moreover he made it appear that he was incensed against her and sent letters to all the kings giving them to know that she had been stricken with madness by the jinns and it is now a year since she hath thus been secluded then continued the ifrit dahnash addressing the ifritah maymunah and i o my lady go to her every night and take my fill of feeding my sight on her face and i kiss her between the eyes yet of my love to her i do her no hurt neither mount her for that her youth is fair and her grace surpassing every one who seeth her jealouseth himself for her i conjure thee therefore o my lady to go back with me and look on her beauty and loveliness and stature and perfection of proportion and after if thou wilt chastise me or enslave me and win to thy will for it is shine to bid and to forbid so saying the ifrit dahnash bowed his head towards the earth and drooped his wings downward but maymunah laughed at his words and spat in his face and answered what is this girl of whom thou pratest but a potsherd wherewith to wipe after making water fn faugh faugh by allah o accursed i thought thou hadst some wondrous tale to tell me or some marvellous news to give me how would it be if thou were to sight my beloved verily this night i have seen a young man whom if thou saw though but in a dream thou wouldst be palsied with admiration and spittle would flow from thy mouth asked the ifrit and who and what is this youth and she answered know o dahnash that there hath befallen the young man the like of what thou tellest me befel thy mistress for his father pressed him again and again to marry but he refused till at length his sire waxed wroth at being opposed and imprisoned him in the tower where i dwell and i came up to night and saw him said dahnash o my lady shew me this youth that i may see if he be indeed handsomer than my mistress the princess budur or not for i cannot believe that the like of her liveth in this our age rejoined maymunah thou liest o accursed o most ill omened of marids and vilest of satans fn sure am i that the like of my beloved is not in this world and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say when it was the one hundred and eightieth night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the ifritah maymunah spake thus to the ifrit dahnash sure am i that the like of my beloved is not in this world art thou mad to fellow thy beloved with my beloved he said allah upon thee o my lady go back with me and look upon my mistress and after i will with thee and look upon thy beloved she answered it must needs be so o accursed for thou art a knavish devil but i will not go with thee nor shalt thou come with me save upon

conviction come get your record expunged fuck the weapons you brung pocket knife why upset me it s out of l a short and to the point like tyus edney he gon say i ain t a legend try and play me like i ain t top bitch i ll stuff an avocado up yo mama pussy and make you watch live fuckin aladdin remake niggas was mad will smith was all blue tinted i seen where they was comin from but i was more pissed they ain t have you in it you went your whole career without havin bars that s the power of relevance you been on two lists your whole life mine and counter intelligence but you from lebanon i can t call you an afghan but i do wanna put yo fuckin ass in a trash can oh you think you can fight now ever since that lil math scan now you wanna exchange punches with a black man okay try and reach

special unlike us his birth was a parallel universal alignment the story of a kid who became an mc chasin this deep rooted urge that s inside him to one day get up and open the trash can and in that trash can he found the notepad that he currently writes in you think you one of our best writers who the fuck told you that that s true you told another guy you d fly over his house and leave a chem

act your whole life all the main cards you didn t headline none of em ever you ve always been a sideshow an undercard to the undercard so yeah you might be gettin some cheddar but you forgot to build ya image and ya skills with business ain t gettin much better so when it all goes down me the saurus illmac geechi nitty pass we gon be the ones they remember you goin down the west coast history like fonzworth bentley just another outcast that was known for living under his own little umbrella you okay there lil fella you a fake prophet you ain t no goat you puttin up a facade it s a western conference demigod you in the royal presence of an immortal legend that s goin against the local peasant in his own synagogue ain t nobody in the left hemisphere will say your run was better did million on the worldwide web without a single url involved i built grind time and king of the dot from the ground up and when i left them they fell apart i watched as organik shot himself in the leg like cheddar bob then i built the left side connection cause i was never selfish i left you all with an academic hall you can excel in you know do it extra large and i did it all to help you you just never helped yourself evolve so i busted a u turn and came back for your rescue cause i knew if i don t you d always be stuck in this dead end job so now we at a fork in the road where our brains could ve been matched even but instead you goin against the odds of different variables and sets of problems you never trained your little ass brain or your pen to solve its conflicts you not armed for the art of war darfour you aren t ready for armeg gedon drive through your ten bedroom apartment door in a bulldozer swingin a wreckin ball there s fentanyl in every bar your death is calling make you drive yourself into a wall like a tesla car if i hold a sword right then it s fortnite i ll leave him with an epic scar let s see if he has the balls to swing on me when there s a giant metal pole between us like tether ball i m guillotine with the schemes i m razor sharp if i raise the bar your head ll fall but i m way too above you to even snuff you i m on top of the mountain lookin down on him from hella far that s why all i gotta do to win is clown on him like a twisted metal car you put in all this work slavin away and goin extra hard but we never give you the credit it s like all you get to do is hold the debit card i run the west bitch you will never have my repertoire get sat down in a metal chair with an electric helmet on cause that s the only way you ll ever become the head in charge you see red from the lead sparks i put the piece to the side of his ear like a ted talk seminar i bet you never forget this bar you fuckin peasant i m a megastar he s a panhandler rap battler that gotta beg to get on cards you a homeless gambit go fuck yourself in a king of the dot rental car your whole rappin process is catastrophic you go on these long winded tangents and frantically try to gather topics blastin bars all over the map like an israeli soldier on foreign soil aiming at random targets he tryin to cook up a recipe for dizaster but by the time the shit hits the pen and pad looks like a scrambled omelette this shit is like a clash between a batch of your average stagnant content and a masterpiece that was hand weaved by a classic artist instead of beggin and payin for match ups up and down the battle gauntlet this is real game you should ve soaked you from the old school and we gave you all the pro tools protool so you don t got a reason to act like you don t have no logic you can t even cross connect your thoughts and actions if you talked how you rap people would assume you were half retarded just an over dramatic hyperactive bar smith i m doin you the favor in the match up so whatchu call this you tryin to hitch hike a ride on aladdin s carpet you just a bitch lookin for a hand out like jasmine danny stop it you damn near cried cause your summer madness battle didn t happen in august and now ain t gettin santa claus bitch i m not talkin bout wrappin presents i m talkin bags and boxes jabs and crosses i ll leave your shit permanently leakin like a public bathroom faucet have avacodo give you a panoramic view of you gettin your ass handed to you on a brand new panasonic and as far as you payin for your battles i feel like your instagram pics do cause i don t really have no comments you ain t got no followers no believers you ve always you notice it in his whole demeanor you ve always been an over achiever you remind me of the portrait of mona lisa cause you ain t shit but a washed up over rated mediocre diva listen an album with no features a passport with no visa a backwood to a cohiba a disaster like hiroshima with no fema you ve been battle raps little hoe since moesha you get paid crumbs to perform and got no shows of your own either and king of the dot and url doin good on their own so they don t need ya you just a sad little turtle sitting alone at home eating a cold pizza time faggot round danny myers listen diz these type of skills can only come from the gift of kids and you gotta feed em and it makes me reflect on my past life in the colosseum you knew this day was coming other rappers shown you some pity even when i was underground you knew this cat ll comb catacomb through the city me and nitty proved back to back punching was the answer but you hate that style of writing diz sees disease that as a cancer but you stole em s style along with other facets of character how are you a dizaster when i was born black in america young brothers trapped in the area pushed through a machine and forced to come out a soldier like captain america my pen dirty only one of us can say nigga without it bein cringe worthy you a fuckin weirdo i question some of ya moves and such the east hates us so when you lose to them you lose for us i don t know who to trust to come through the clutch when my crew discuss we don t need them what the fuck can mook and lux do for us i have been a beast this ain t the time for you to be middle east riddle me why the fuck should i be scared now mentally i try to tear down durin the stare down y all niggas can elevate i d rather take the stairs down a king who wears crowns ain t wit his people i m aware now i flare rounds this bitch gon make me palm a glock i m wildin but this could end different indifferent if i m nonchalant a young man was bullied by terry and his crew they was known for carryin them triggers his granny told him to keep the faith it ll be less scary in a minute do you believe in a parallel universe i do they killed him at sunday service his family stressed buried his figure he died in front of the christian church pressed by terry and presbyterian them niggas i battled at your costume party and your ether event we supposed to be homies but i ain t get paid for either event now i ain t tryin to knock our unity but if we supposed to be homies why the fuck would you pay me in opportunity you use people this is what the whole fam knew cause dizaster beat me here in this pit no can do nocando both hands true aim like i came from the best military thinkin you comin back after i bury this cat like pet cemetery i hope your next flight is booked on a max and the sensor tells it to nosedive i hope his whole family is on that flight and everyone he knows dies unborn babies ripped from they mother s bellies blood and guts in the fuselage you wake up everybody is dead but you alive i will survive plays from an ipod while you waitin on a rescue team i hope you get ptsd from all the fuckin death you ve seen i hope your drier eats every match to your socks i hope your next movie starts off with you gettin socked i hope you go home and all ya homies hog tied i hope john wick hears that you happy that his dog died he said fuck king of the dot i m never comin back bodied sold four tickets he called organik like i ain t mean that shit i got some more lyrics you don t need a gas station and none of those promotionals how ironic the term oil turmoil gets him emotional i m smokin you he like to act black when he performs shows the day he start gettin his hair twisted is when this corn rose rows you from the he don t even be in l a that s all that pretty shit we see when we leavin l a suicidal on total slaughter talkin bout freein himself you impersonate all of us cause you ain t comfortable bein yourself i m the goat bitch and you can get the fuck out bitch i brought lyrics back to the bay on some yukmouth shit and even though he already on the ground with the shit thank the lord he ain t got another round of this shit yikes round dizaster now first of all you act like you don t have homies witchu too yeah i got homies too whatchu talkin about except the ones that are behind you don t look the same after fuckin daylyt marked him out yo check this out yo listen to this lsc shit we made you a part of the family tree and we seeded you cause you from soil so bein loyal i felt like i needed too but you never developed into this fully grown tree your roots covered in weeds with the bottom tier mc s still picking all of your leaves from you and all that leaves for you is me raking up what you leave when the season s through he s but now poppin he s a late bloomer it all stems from greed every single thing you do is for you danny you a gmo tree cause every mission you embark on gives us nothin but seedless fruits i extended you an olive branch but you said you didn t need me to couldn t even keep your feet planted and believe me you ain t never been believable that s why we got geechi to keep the balance and make it even between you two we even gave you a boost of self esteem that you needed yeah but you wanted to be the leader which is leaving you down this down this dark path and now we just watch back as your ego slowly eats at you could you even handle a real defeat like really have we ever seen you fall so bad you lost half the people that once believed in you only to make a comeback and drag those very same people underneath your shoes the irony cause right now it s exactly what you see me do but you didn t even though you had more of a reason to when we started the lsc movement to challenge them as a team unit versus the eastern crew but couldn t keep you on the same page cause every other week or two danny had a battle in like a week or two talkin bout me supporting him how the fuck am i gonna support you when you was on some tekken shit and i always had to deal with your secret moves i talk to beasley you talk to beasley too that s when we knew you was self centered you only center yourself in the scenic view and it s feeding you and for y all that are payin attention that s real pen game not the type of shit he do my definition of good writing is different from what it means to you for you it s what the punchline means for me it s actually being meaningful listen to this you the goat oh you got more history than me well let s give y all a battle rap west coast lesson let s take this back to how it all started from the beginning it was like you was probably one of the only ones out here spittin right that was two years after the rap olympics in that eminem was in but by then it was already finished in the i e the they had the foundation and cats from l a every other day would go up there and then kill it every other night cats like otherwize would go through a dozen guys but you was nowhere in attendance scribble jam was a year prior to that but somehow you also wasn t in it wrc s two years in a row he never entered the pit the hub of our city you just didn t visit the basement in the even that you wasn t with it grind time came and went and you still ain t represented so all we got left from you is your fight klub footage which to me is like oj simpson cause it s still up in the air whether you ever did it but in his defense let s analyse that for a second right you said out ya own mouth you moved out to new york in to battle rap for a living so if you wasn t shit over here and never became shit over there then where the fuck was you winnin see like don t you get it even if you was on fight klub that don t make no difference you want us to crown you as california s own legends when all the work you put in was benefiting outta state folks and propelling the east coast engine and you still the same kid today who you kidding fuck you mean south central bitch we was at project blowed all the time battlin when we was only children i guess that wasn t y all lane like the pentagon plane he can t even provide evidence that he was ever in the buildin you wanna talk about my shit i took this shit from the mud to the mainstream way past the limits what you lookin at here is a plastic gimmick another surrogate movie i embody everything he isn t you can check my files real work you can verify with analytics people tryin to harp on my fuckin losses but after battles i still have the highest body bag percentage and through the ups and downs i still got more fans than critics if you been through half this shit your bitch ass wouldn t last a minute i was down on my last leg until i got back in it liftin myself back up like popeye and popped open a can of spinach i know you was expectin a haymaker that s why dan don t get it yeah he likes haymakers and punchlines but forgot to brand his image yeah you got the battlin spirit but what good is a haymaker punchline if it don t come with a fuckin personality with it and that s the real reality check for me cause your whole style built like the most random accessory you come with a battery in your back and personality sold separately how much of a fuckin clout chasin cat can you be you want me to respect all of your west accomplishments when your best west accomplishment was standin here battlin me yeah he s part of our gathering but you re the weakest branch on our family tree you re six years older than me and call me your o g you can t tell me shit i do not know besides the fact that you do not know me but since you into science i ma use the rest of this round with science to break you down slowly y all ready this is gonna be slow so y all get it now scientists ponder does the universe exist if no one is there to bare witness to its appearance they say technically the universe is not there if there s no one around to perceive it now this is what i mean is you said you bodied drag on from ruff ryders let s say i actually believe it let s say you didn t dream it the question is did you really body drag on if there s no one else on earth that can confirm that they seen it they say you gotta see it to believe it and that s not just a saying it comes from a deeper meaning that s a scientific thesis deeply rooted in one of the universes deepest secrets cause you said you won those battles how do we know it s a fact since there s a chance it s not the outcome of that reality is now split both into halves now for something in this universe to be definite two particles would have to go from a point of super position to a point of collapse that s when the moment becomes definite if nobody knows it s happening they don t know how to act let s take a cat a little kitten put it in a box and we close it now whether you leave the box closed or you open it back listen to this hold on you take a kitten you put it in a box but a probability of it dying at a chance now whether you leave the box closed or you open it back you decide whether it s dead or alive by merely the observational act even if you know it s in there dead if you don t see it with both your eyes then technically it never died and that s schrodinger s cat now danny you are the observer splitting the universe into two parallel straight lines forming a reality where your opponents were both dead and alive at the same time what i m saying is in laymen terms for you to understand it if the impact of your battles didn t cause a butterfly effect or a chain reaction in a way it didn t happen and i know science can t give me a straight answer i m not about to dig my grandfather outta the grave to ask him the point is in this battle universe if we can t look up your work online in a youtube search then i ma have to revert how they came up with this conclusion first only one solution works that all these battles danny talkin bout happened in his parallel universe so do i believe in a parallel universe i do i believe the parallel universe is a lower vibrational field you spent most of your career confined to i believe in a multiverse billions of different realities we might choose and the one we re living in right now is the only one we survive through now in this universe i just schooled you like my fucking son before i m fucking done i ma give you preview of what s happening in the other one you don t wanna squab danny your little fuckin body brittle you small and little you ain t john gotti is you you ve seen what a battle with gotti gets you battle wit me you gonna be like pamela lee cause you gon lose half ya shit soon as the tommy hit you i ll fuckin shotty clip you i ll put a shotgun to ya ugly ass face and i ll pocket check you you from south central ah nah you never claimed a set or popped the pistol it s obvious you aren t official you artificial dawg not marketable stop actin like you got a problem wit me cause i don t got a problem witchu but if you want the issue then it s reservoir dogs i m tearin off cartilage tissue which means i ain t just gassin on you i m dumpin the whole gas can on you dawg i hit you wit an atomic missile in the bush ready to pop out like bonnie s nipple i ll have you walkin around with war shrapnel lodged into you vice grip around ya neck i will homer bart simpson you drop kick you it s a fact if you snap i ll snapple twist ya top off ,"['page',
